Provide only the story, no extra context or explanation. \n\nWei strolled through the quiet streets of the old town, the setting sun casting a warm orange glow over the crumbling buildings. She had always loved this time of day, when the crowds had dissipated and the shops were shutting down for the night. It was a time for solitude, for contemplation, for letting her thoughts wander.\n\nAs she walked, the scent of incense wafted through the air, carried on the gentle breeze. Wei breathed deeply, feeling the fragrance settle in her chest. It was a scent she associated with her grandmother, who had used to burn incense to calm her nerves after a long day.\n\nWei turned a corner, and the sounds of the town's evening revelries began to filter in. Laughter and music drifted through the air, mingling with the scent of incense and the distant clang of pots and pans from the night markets. She smiled to herself, feeling the excitement building in her chest.\n\nShe passed by the large stone dragon that stood guard outside the Temple of the Five Elements. The dragon's eyes gleamed with a soft, golden light, and Wei felt a shiver run down her spine. To her, the dragon represented the ancient wisdom and mysticism that infused the townspeople with a sense of purpose and belonging.\n\nWei stopped in front of a small shop that she had passed countless times before. Tonight, however, she felt a sudden urge to enter. She pushed open the door, and was immediately enveloped in the cozy warmth of the shop. The proprietor, Old Man Li, looked up from behind the counter, his eyes twinkling with recognition.\n\n\"Ah, Wei,\" he said, his voice low and soothing. \"Come in, come in. You look like you could use a cup of tea.\"\n\nWei smiled, and nodded her head. Old Man Li gestured for her to take a seat on one of the soft cushions strewn about the shop. He poured her a steaming cup of tea, and handed it to her with a knowing look. \"I sense you have questions, Wei,\" he said, his voice barely above a whisper. \"Questions that only the tea leaves can answer.\"\n\nWei smiled, feeling a sense of peace settle over her. In this moment, she knew that everything would be alright. She waited patiently as Old Man Li listened to the rumbles of the tea leaves, his eyes scanning the delicate patterns with a practiced hand.\n\n\"What do you see, Old Man?\" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.\n\nOld Man Li smiled, his eyes locked on hers. \"You are at a crossroads, Wei. A decision lies ahead of you. Trust your instincts, and trust the wisdom of the ancient ones. Follow your heart, and the path will reveal itself.\"\n\nWei took a sip of the tea, feeling its bitter flavor settle in her chest. She smiled, knowing that she would face whatever challenges lay ahead with courage and clarity. With Old Man Li's words etched in her mind, she left the shop, feeling the weight of the world's expectations lifted from her shoulders. She knew that she would always find her way, no matter what lay ahead. And so, with a heart full of hope and promise, she stepped out into the evening's glow, ready to face whatever the future might hold.  ••••••••••••••••••••••••••\n\nA woman and her husband drove home from the hospital, two small, wrapped forms in the backseat. The woman's eyes darted nervously towards the rearview mirror, where the forms moved and shifted in the dim light of the dashboard. She reached out a trembling hand and gently stroked the soft bundle atop her husband's knee. \n\n\"Are you sure it's okay?\" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. \n\nHer husband turned to her, his eyes fixed on the road ahead. \"I'm positive, Rachel,\" he said. \"We've got plenty of space at home. The city is full of families in the same situation as us. We're just as deserving of a chance as anyone else.\"\n\nRachel nodded, though she didn't seem entirely convinced. The thought of adopting two little ones was daunting, to say the least. But as she looked over at her husband, she saw the determined look on his face and her doubts began to fade. She took a deep breath, letting her shoulders relax into their familiar slump.\n\nThe car pulled up to the curb outside their small apartment, and Rachel's husband swung the rear door open. \"Let's get them settled in,\" he said, his voice warm with reassurance.\n\nRachel nodded, her eyes scanning the entrance hall of her home. It was cluttered, chaotic, but it was their space, and it would be perfect for a new family. Her husband's hand brushed against hers, and she smiled, feeling a sense",
