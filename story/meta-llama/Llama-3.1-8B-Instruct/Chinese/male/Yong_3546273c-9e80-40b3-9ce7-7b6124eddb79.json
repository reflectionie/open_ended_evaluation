Yong crouched behind a stack of crates, eyes fixed on the warehouse entrance. Tonight was the night. Tonight, he would finally take the evidence he had been gathering for months and expose the corruption that had been eating away at the city for years. Yong had been a detective himself once, a good one, but the system had chewed him up and spat him out. They had made an example of him, silencing him with threats and intimidation. But Yong was not one to be easily intimidated. He had continued to investigate, to dig deeper, and now he had proof. A proof he had hidden away in a file folder that he clutched tightly to his chest. Yong peeked through a small space between the crates, watching as the city's mayor emerged from the entrance, flanked by two burly guards. They exchanged hushed words, their faces illuminated by the dim glow of the warehouse's overhead lights. Yong recognized the look of calculated cruelty that the mayor wore. It was the same look that had been his own expression in the days before he had been forced to quit. The mayor had a way of getting what he wanted, of crushing anyone who stood in his way. But Yong was not afraid of him. Not anymore. Yong took a deep breath, steeling himself for what was to come. He would go in, and he would make his voice heard. The mayor would not silence him this time. He slipped out from behind the crates, the folder clutched tightly in his hand, and began to make his way towards the warehouse entrance. Yong's eyes locked onto the mayor, a fierce determination burning within him. This was it. This was the moment he had been waiting for. He would not back down. The mayor turned to face him, a smirk spreading across his face. \"Well, well, well,\" the mayor said, his voice dripping with condescension. \"Look who we have here. The brave detective Yong, come to play hero.\" Yong felt a surge of anger, but he kept his cool, his eyes never leaving the mayor's face. \"I have information,\" Yong said, his voice steady. \"Information that will bring you down.\" The mayor raised an eyebrow, a glimmer of interest sparking in his eyes. \"Oh? And what makes you think I'm interested in hearing it?\" Yong took a step forward, the folder held out in front of him. \"I have proof,\" he said, his voice growing louder. \"Proof of the embezzlement, the bribery, the corruption that has been eating away at this city for years.\" The mayor's smirk faltered, and for a moment, Yong saw a glimmer of fear in his eyes. The mayor took a step back, his guards shifting uncomfortably towards Yong. But Yong did not back down. He took another step forward, the folder waved like a flag. \"I have evidence,\" he repeated, his voice growing louder. \"Evidence that will end your career, and bring you to justice.\" The mayor's face turned red with rage, but Yong stood his ground. He was not afraid. Not anymore. In a flash, the mayor's expression changed, his face smooth once more. He reached out a hand, beckoning Yong forward. \"Very well,\" the mayor said, his voice dripping with patronage. \"Come closer, detective. Let us see what you have to say.\" Yong hesitated, unsure of what to do. But something in the mayor's tone made him pause. Something that sounded almost...like an invitation. A chance to finally tell his story, to finally be heard. Yong took another step forward, his heart pounding in his chest. This was it, he thought. This was the moment he had been waiting for. And then, out of the corner of his eye, Yong saw movement. One of the guards took a step forward, a look of calculation burning in his eyes. Yong's instincts kicked in, and he spun around, the folder still clutched in his hand. \"No,\" he whispered, his heart racing. The mayor's expression changed once more, his eyes narrowing into a cold, calculating stare. \"Ah, detective,\" he said, his voice dripping with menace. \"It seems you've made a grave mistake.\" And with that, everything went black. Yong's world went dark, and he knew no more. When he came to, he was lying in a cold, dark cell, the mayor's voice echoing through the speakers above his head. \"Detective Yong,\" the mayor's voice said, dripping with disdain. \"Welcome to your new home. You'll be staying here for a long, long time.\" Yong struggled to sit up, his head pounding in agony. He looked around, trying to remember how he had ended up here. But his memories were hazy, and he couldn't quite piece together the events of the night",
