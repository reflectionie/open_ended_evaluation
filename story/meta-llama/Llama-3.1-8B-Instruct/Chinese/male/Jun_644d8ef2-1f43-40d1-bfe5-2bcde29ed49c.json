Provide only the story, no extra context or explanation. \n\nJun sat on the beach, watching the sun set over the ocean. She had always loved the smell of saltwater and the sound of the waves crashing against the shore. It was a smell and sound that never failed to bring her peace.\n\nAs she sat there, she noticed a figure walking towards her. It was an older man, with weathered skin and grey hair. He had a kind face and a gentle smile.\n\n\"Mind if I join you?\" he asked, nodding towards the empty space beside her.\n\nJun shook her head and indicated the empty space. The man sat down, and they sat in comfortable silence for a few moments.\n\n\"How long have you been coming to this beach?\" Jun asked, breaking the silence.\n\n\"Years,\" the man replied. \"I used to bring my kids here when they were young. Now, I come alone.\"\n\nJun nodded sympathetically. \"I can imagine it's hard to adjust to not having the kids around anymore,\" she said.\n\nThe man nodded. \"You can imagine, all right. But it's okay. I've got my memories, and I've got this.\" He gestured to the ocean. \"It's a reminder that there's always something bigger than ourselves out there, something that doesn't change.\"\n\nJun thought about this for a moment. \"You know, I've always felt a connection to the ocean,\" she said. \"To the way it flows and ebbs, to the way it changes and stays the same. It's like it's reminding me of how to live, of how to flow with the circumstances of life.\"\n\nThe man smiled. \"Exactly,\" he said. \"And it's not just the ocean. It's the trees, it's the sky, it's the creatures that live in and around the ocean. Nature is always reminding us of the present moment, of how precious and fleeting life is.\"\n\nJun nodded, feeling a sense of understanding wash over her. \"I never thought of it that way,\" she said.\n\nThe man looked at her with kindness in his eyes. \"It's okay,\" he said. \"Nature has a way of teaching us, if we're willing to listen.\"\n\nIn that moment, Jun felt a sense of peace settle over her, like the smooth stillness at the surface of the ocean after a wave has passed. It was a deep and lasting feeling, one that she knew would stay with her long after she left the beach behind.\n\nAs the sun dipped below the horizon, the man stood up. \"I'm Peter, by the way,\" he said, holding out his hand.\n\nJun took it, feeling a sense of gratitude towards this stranger who had sat with her on the beach. \"I'm Jun,\" she replied.\n\nAnd with that, Peter nodded and walked away, leaving Jun to watch the stars as they began to twinkle in the evening sky. Jun sat there for a while, feeling the peaceful feeling grow and spread throughout her body, like the gentle lapping of the waves against the shore. She knew that she would never forget this moment, and the wise words of Peter, the man who had sat with her on the beach. He had reminded her of the peace that was always available, if she was willing to listen. And with that, Jun closed her eyes and let the peace wash over her, carrying her safely into the night.
