Provide only the story, no extra context or explanation. \n\nHua knelt in front of the temple, her back against the cool stone and her head in her hands. The sun beat down on the back of her neck, warming it to a pleasant heat. Her eyes drifted shut, and with them, the thoughts of the day began to untangle. \n\nIn the village, life had been moving at a deliberate pace. Old Mrs. Wei had finally learned to weave her own clothes, a triumph after years of seeking help from the young ones. Hua had watched with pride as the ancient woman carefully measured thread and fabric. \n\nBut for Hua, daily tasks held little meaning. Her hands continued to move of their own accord, carrying her to places she hadn't intended to go. She couldn't resist the urge to enter the abandoned mill down by the river, to imagine what might have been its purpose in the past. Her mind wandered there often, filling the dusty rooms with people and sound. \n\nA gentle hand on her shoulder broke the spell. An old man stood before her, his eyes wrinkled and deep. He wore a plain white tunic and carried a staff – a sign of the village elder. \n\nHua stood slowly, her hair tangled in her hands. \"You came,\" she said, feeling a sense of peace settle in.\n\n\"I always come,\" the elder replied, his voice low and reassuring. \"You've been missing for days, child. Your family worries.\"\n\nHua's gaze skittered around the temple grounds, taking in the rows of quiet people sitting on benches. Some had their eyes closed, while others seemed to be staring at the ground. They were the seekers, here to quiet their minds and uncover answers.\n\n\"I've found something,\" the elder said, taking a seat beside Hua. \"You've discovered the river spirit.\"\n\nHua's thoughts scattered, and she forgot to breathe. The river spirit, a creature of legend, known to dance in the surface of the water under the full moon. No one had seen it in years, not since the great drought when the river had nearly vanished.\n\nThe elder laid a hand on her arm. \"You didn't see it as a vision, did you? But somehow you understand.\"\n\nShe didn't know what to say. Hua felt it, the presence she'd sensed near the mill. It called to her, an elusive and tantalizing thread.\n\nThe old man's eyes narrowed. \"Be warned, child. This can't be ignored. The balance is shifting, and with it, the very fabric of our world. You've been chosen for something greater. I know not what, but the village...the village will call upon you.\"\n\nIn the sudden stillness, Hua felt small and scared. Chosen? For what? She had so many questions, but before she could ask any of them, the elder had stood, saying one more thing: \"The temple will hold your name, Hua, in memory.\"\n\nAs he turned and made his way back to the village, Hua was left alone once more with the sun on her back and the temple stone against her skin. But now, something loomed in the background of her mind – a weight that could no longer be ignored. When the villagers called, as surely they would, would she be ready?  As her eyes remained shut, Hua's very soul waited to respond to that question.   \n\n\nBut she knew she wasn't prepared yet.    She knew the answer had only just begun to unfurl, a path that she had just begun by seeing something deep inside her soul. She knew that the river spirit would haunt her for a long time. The questions were beginning to gather in her mind. The old man had called her \"chosen\" but she did not know what that meant. She had a feeling that nothing would ever be the same as before. She tried to open her eyes but the warmth and tranquility of the sunlight closed her eyes once again.    \n Hua opened her eyes at last. Her hand felt the presence of the stone and her eyes still felt the warm sun. She sat on the stone, trying to remember the conversation she'd just had. The words 'the balance is shifting' and 'the village will call upon you' came flooding back. The old man said she'd been chosen, but he gave no explanation. \n\n She recalled seeing something while at the river, something that she couldn't quite explain. It was then that she realized the old man's words were connected to something else inside her. The presence at the river, the thread beckoning her – she knew that she wasn't imagining things, even if she couldn't see anything tangible.\n\n Hua rose from the temple ground. As she walked out of the temple grounds, she knew that she was no longer the same person. She was on a journey of transformation, where the boundaries between reality and fantasy were no longer",
