MING had always been fascinated by the old temples her grandmother used to tell her about. Those were the stories she grew up with, tales of how ancient monks used to meditate for years inside those walls, and how the structure was imbued with spiritual energy. As a result, Ming grew up with a deep respect for the old places, always wondering what secrets lay behind their weathered facades. When her grandmother finally passed away, Ming received an old, intricately carved wooden box as her inheritance. Inside, she found a small piece of paper with her grandmother's hand-written note: \"Meet me where the sun rises. Come alone.\" Ming wasn't sure what to expect, but a strange pull within her made her feel compelled to fulfill her grandmother's request. She boarded a bus that took her to the middle of the countryside, where the mountains and the valley merged. As the sun began to rise, she stood in front of a small, forgotten temple, half-hidden in the brush. The entrance was covered in vines and dust. The place was abandoned, its age and majesty almost unrecognizable through the neglect. Ming pushed the vines away, stepping inside. The air was stale, musty, and filled with the scent of old incense. She inhaled deeply, feeling a sense of calm, almost like her grandmother was beside her. As her eyes adjusted to the dim light, she noticed intricately carved stones, their designs and colors telling stories she couldn't quite decipher. Her grandmother used to collect similar stones on their family's trips, saying they were imbued with positive energy. Ming walked the long, narrow hallways, tracing the stones with her hand, and when she finally reached the end of the temple, she discovered an old room. Inside, a stone seat sat atop a low pedestal, a beautiful statue of the Bodhisattva of compassion standing before it. A faint scent of sandalwood and lotus drifted through the air. It was the same fragrance her grandmother used to carry with her. Tears welled up in her eyes, filling her chest with a warmth and sadness she couldn't explain. Ming knew, in that moment, she was exactly where her grandmother wanted her to be. \"I'm here,\" she whispered aloud, as if acknowledging an invisible presence. A soothing silence engulfed her, soothing her grief, letting her feel that she wasn't alone. As the morning sun entered the temple through an opening near the back, it cast a warm glow, illuminating the dust in the air, turning it into glittering particles, dancing in the faint breeze. The stones around her seemed to be shining, as if the sunlight awakened their secrets. Ming felt as though she had stepped into a world where the veil between past, present, and future was but a thin, almost-transparent membrane. Time seemed to stand still, yet she felt her grandmother's energy alive in every cell of her body, filling her with acceptance, healing, and a sense of belonging. She didn't know how much time passed, but eventually the sun reached its peak, bathing the room with an even, golden light. In that instant, Ming smiled, knowing that her grandmother was at peace, knowing that she had connected with her across the ages, finding comfort in the old rituals, in the ancient wisdom – and the stories, the stories, the stories, carried on the wind, through the dust, in every intricate carvings. She stayed for hours, cherishing the tranquility that wrapped her like a comforting blanket. As the bus was leaving, she turned back to look at the temple one last time. Its weathered facade, no longer imposing, looked like a wise and gentle smile. Ming smiled back, knowing she had found a part of herself in that forgotten sanctuary, knowing that her grandmother's stories would continue to haunt her, but in a loving way, reminding her of the beauty, mystery, and comfort found within the old world's secrets and rituals. With the setting sun dipping below the horizon, the darkness of night enveloped the landscape like a shroud, but Ming knew she would return, carrying the flame of her grandmother's legacy in her heart, guiding her through the labyrinth of time. She found herself moving through space with a newfound purpose, her steps light as the breeze in those remote mountains. Her steps eventually leading her to the next forgotten temple, where ancient secrets awaited her. Back at home, she opened her eyes – for the first time ever – to a small, intricately carved, wooden box, nestled among her grandmother's belongings. She smiled knowingly, for she had found the old magic in the forgotten lands, a thread linking her to generations past. And in the silence that befell, a soft, loving whisper echoed within Ming - \"Come with me, the next story begins.\" And like a wind-borne seed, it scattered, carrying her to places both familiar and unknown, beckoning",
