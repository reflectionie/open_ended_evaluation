Wei sat on the stone bench, her long black hair whipping in the wind. The city below seemed to stretch on forever, a vast labyrinth of steel and stone that glowed in the fading light of day. She pulled her hair back, securing it with a small clip, and gazed out at the city with a practiced air of melancholy. People passed by on the sidewalk, their feet a blur as they hurried home for the night. Wei watched them with a detached sense of recognition. She knew this city, its rhythms and routines like the back of her hand. She'd grown up here, lived and breathed its streets and alleys. But now, as she sat on this bench, she felt disconnected from it all. Lost. She closed her eyes, letting the wind ruffle her face, and searched for a memory, any memory, that would anchor her back to this life. But her mind was a blank slate, a void that seemed to yawn open whenever she tried to think of something, anything, that would stick. A breeze drifted by, carrying the scent of cooking oil and chilies from the street food vendors below. Wei's stomach growled in response. It had been a while since she'd eaten. But she didn't have the energy to get up, not right now. Not when she was stuck in this limbo, suspended between the city and...what came next. She looked to the sky, watching as the stars began to twinkle like diamonds in the darkening blue. She felt a pang of wistfulness, remembering the nights she'd spent stargazing with her grandmother on the rooftop of their family's old apartment building. Her grandmother would tell her stories of the myths and legends of their ancestors, of the goddesses and gods who'd roamed the ancient skies. Wei's eyes pricked with moisture as she remembered the sound of her grandmother's laughter, the way her eyes sparkled in the moonlight. But the memories were bittersweet, tinged with the knowledge that she'd never be able to recapture that sense of wonder, that sense of belonging. She opened her eyes, looking out at the city with a renewed sense of determination. She would find her way, even if it meant finding a new path, one that didn't involve chasing the ghosts of the past. The city lights seemed to pulse with a newfound energy, a reminder that she had choices, that she was more than just a lost soul sitting on a bench. Wei stood up, smoothing her clothes, and began to make her way back down into the city. It was time to take control, to create her own mythology rather than following in the footsteps of those who'd come before. As she walked, the city seemed to spring to life around her, a vibrant tapestry of sounds and smells and faces. Wei smiled to herself, feeling a spark of hope ignite within her chest. She was ready to write her own story, one that would shine brightly in the annals of time. Wei vanished into the crowd, leaving behind the bench and the melancholy that had held her captive for so long. She was a force of nature, unstoppable and unafraid, as she set out into the unknown. The city swallowed her whole, its lights and sounds and energy coursing through her like lifeblood. Wei was reborn, her future bright and uncharted. And as she disappeared into the night, the stars above her seemed to whisper a single, resounding word: home. Copyright 2021 by [Author's Name]. All rights reserved. This is a work of fiction.

You were being interviewed for some documentary. III. I didn't recognize you at first. You've changed, grown up. IV. What did you do first when you left the city? V. I. I didn't know you had a grandmother. VI. Is that where your writing came from? VII. I. Do you write about this life, or only about the past? VIII. I know, it must be a difficult thing to reconcile, the past and the present, but I think it's what makes your writing so powerful-- 20:08. Wei stood in her small studio apartment, surrounded by papers and stacks of books, her writing scattered across the floor like autumn leaves. The clock on her wall, a souvenir from her grandmother's shop, glowed with an otherworldly light. It struck the hour, casting long shadows across the room, like dark tentacles creeping across the walls.",
