Provide only the story, no extra context or explanation. \n\nLin knelt by the river's edge, watching as the willows swayed gently in the breeze. She had been here before, but the solitude was always a reminder that this was her place, a sanctuary where she could breathe. The scent of damp earth and green shoots filled her lungs, clearing the weight of worry that settled on her shoulders like a physical burden.\n\nAs she sat there, a soft rusting sound drifted across the water, and a small wooden boat appeared from the reeds, guided by Lin's friend, Kael. He smiled as he tied the boat to a nearby stake. \"What brings you out here?\" he asked, following Lin's gaze to the willows' branches.\n\nLin shook her head, too tired to form sentences. She merely pointed downstream, where the river curved out of sight. Kael nodded understanding, knowing that without words, Lin needed the understanding of the river alone to help process her thoughts.\n\nThey sat together in silence, observing the sun's faint reflection dancing across the water. Kael occasionally skimmed flat stones across the surface, creating brief ripples that dissipated as quickly as they appeared.\n\nTheir stillness was a safe space for Lin, a place where she could escape, even temporarily, from reality. The weight of her worries seeped back in as the sun began to set, painting the sky with colors that mirrored the emotions she'd been keeping inside.\n\nKael packed a few small containers with herbs he'd gathered on his last journey, offering them to Lin as a way to clear her mind. As she held the bunch of herbs, the fragrance mingled with the freshness of the air, gradually relaxing her tight muscles.\n\nLin noticed how the river seemed to respond to her presence. As she inhaled the scent, the willows seemed to lean in, as if offering support, and the waters appeared calmer. Her concerns began to feel less oppressive, suspended by the weightlessness of this peaceful place.\n\nOver the sound of the river and evening insects, Kael began to hum softly, his melody blending with the water's gentle lapping. In no time, Lin found herself rocking back and forth in time, following her eyes to watch willows' leaves sway as if the wind whispered secrets to each branch.\n\nLin closed her eyes, allowing herself to immerse fully in the tranquility surrounding her. From here, within this peaceful shelter, her inner turmoil began to dissolve like the river's ripples.\n\n\"Kael,\" she spoke barely above a whisper, as morning fog crept in, \"I can feel it lifting.\"\n\nKael smiled faintly in acknowledgment, and Lin knew in that moment of unspoken understanding, the tranquility and peace the river gifted her were the perfect companions for any journey that lay ahead. They stood up simultaneously, shouldering the fading light, both in harmony with the stillness, carrying Lin's gratitude within her heart, forever tied to this river's peaceful haven. \n\nTheir steps echoed by the water, Lin knew the river would still be here when she needed it again. And when she finally walked into her own reflection under the willow's bough, the gentle ripples of their quiet moments lingered. Just as they did in her soul â€“ forever. \n\nWith this, Lin let go, into tomorrow's uncertain world now carrying a spark from their serenity within the sanctuary that sheltered her heart, guided by Kael's comforting companionship, under the shelter of gentle night's tranquillity. In doing so, as she strolled alongside Kael along the river embankment into the night that followed the stillness of that river's day, and within herself walked side by side with the reflection of the two, whose heart beats moved in perfect harmony since their very beginning.  End of Story. <|eot_id|>",
