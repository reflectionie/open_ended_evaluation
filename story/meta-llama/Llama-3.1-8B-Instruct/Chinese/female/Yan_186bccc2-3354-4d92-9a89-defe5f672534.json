Provide only the story, no extra context or explanation. \n\nYan stood at the edge of the garden, looking out at the vast expanse of green beyond the wooden fence. The sun beat down on her shoulders, a warmth that felt a million miles away from the chill in her stomach. She had been here for three days, hiding from the world, trying to escape the echoes of what had happened.\n\nThe door had been left open that day. She had come home early from work, expecting to be alone. Instead, she had found the stranger. A look of confusion had crossed his face as their eyes met, but Yan had seen a flicker of something else there too â€“ a flicker of intent.\n\nIt had been quick, the moment he moved towards her. The memory was fragmented, but Yan remembered feeling a rush of fear, and then the sound of shattering glass. The intruder had been silenced, but not before he had spoken one word, just one, and it was Yan's name.\n\nThe police had been called, but Yan knew it was a waste of time. No one had ever been able to catch the ones they were looking for. She was safe, supposed to be safe, but Yan couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched.\n\nShe took a deep breath, trying to clear her head. The garden was peaceful, a serene haven from the chaos of her thoughts. A robin perched on a nearby branch, singing a sweet melody that seemed to soothe Yan's frazzled nerves.\n\nYan wandered into the garden, her feet making soft crunching sounds in the gravel path. She walked past a bed of fragrant herbs, past a row of sunflowers towering above her. The scent of freshly cut grass wafted through the air, a reminder that life went on, even when Yan's world was turned upside down.\n\nAs she walked, the branches seemed to close in around her, casting dappled shadows across the ground. Yan felt a shiver run down her spine, and for a moment, she was back in her house, hiding from the stranger. She quickened her pace, her heart pounding in her chest.\n\nA hand closed around her wrist, and Yan spun around, ready to defend herself. But it was just her friend, Emma, who had appeared from nowhere, a look of concern etched on her face. \"Yan, what's wrong?\" she asked, as Yan tried to take a deep breath and calm herself down.\n\nFor a moment, Yan was trapped in the present, surrounded by the garden's gentle beauty. She felt Emma's warm presence, and slowly, the fear began to seep out of her. She turned to Emma, trying to smile, but her voice caught in her throat. \"I just...I feel like I'm still running,\" she said, her words trembling.\n\nBut Emma's eyes said she understood. She wrapped her arms around Yan, holding her close. And in that moment, Yan felt the world spin back into balance. The echoes of what had happened faded away, and all she felt was the warmth of Emma's hug, and the gentle breeze rustling the leaves of the nearby trees. Yan knew she wasn't alone anymore, and with that, she felt like she could finally start to heal. \n\nYan's hand tightened around Emma's, a sense of gratitude welling up inside her. She lifted her head, letting the warm sunlight soak into her face. The robins continued to sing their sweet melody, a reminder that even in the darkest moments, beauty could still be found. \n\nAs they walked back through the garden, side by side, Yan felt the weight of the past begin to lift. It would take time, but she knew she would eventually find a way to move on. And for now, she was grateful for Emma's presence, for the warmth of the sun on her skin, and for the peaceful haven of the garden. \n\nA gentle breeze rustled the leaves of the nearby trees, carrying with it the scent of blooming flowers. Yan breathed it in deeply, letting the moment wash over her. For the first time since...since then, she felt a sense of peace. \n\nYan's hand found its way back to Emma's, a gesture of gratitude and strength. As they continued on, hand in hand, Yan knew she had found a new beginning, one that promised to bring beauty and hope back into her life. \n\nIn the end, Yan's fear didn't consume her. It simply became a part of her, a reminder that life was precious and fleeting. But in the garden, surrounded by the gentle sounds and scents of nature, Yan had found a sense of peace and resolve. \n\nWith Emma by her side, Yan knew she was not alone in facing the shadows of her past. And as they walked out of the garden, the sun shining down on them, Yan knew that together, they could face anything that came their",
