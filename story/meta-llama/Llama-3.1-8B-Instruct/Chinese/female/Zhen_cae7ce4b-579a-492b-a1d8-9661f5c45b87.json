Provide only the story, no extra context or explanation. \nZhen woke up to the sound of water dripping from the faucet in the kitchen. She lay in bed for a moment, listening to the steady droplets fall into the sink below. It was a habit of hers to begin her day this way, sitting up and letting the world outside wake her up to its rhythms. Her mother had done the same when Zhen was a child, and she remembered the sound as a comforting one, always signaling the start of a new day.\n\nAs she threw off the covers and swung her legs over the side of the bed, Zhen felt a sense of familiarity wash over her. She ran her hand through her hair, taking a moment to stretch before standing up and padding barefoot into the kitchen. She loved mornings like this, ones where the sun wasn't too bright and the world outside her window was still quiet. It was a time for reflection, a moment to think about what she wanted from the day ahead.\n\nAs she approached the sink, Zhen saw that her roommate, Ling, had already started breakfast. There were scrambled eggs sizzling in a pan on the stovetop, and the unmistakable smell of cooking rice filled the air. Zhen's stomach growled at the sight and she smiled, feeling grateful for Ling's presence in their small apartment.\n\nOver breakfast, the two friends talked about their plans for the day. Ling was working on a new art piece, a sculpture of a bird in mid-flight, and was hoping to get some of it finished today. Zhen didn't have any concrete plans of her own, but was thinking of heading to the park for a walk.\n\nAs they ate, Zhen felt a sense of contentment settle over her. It was this kind of quiet, peaceful morning that she loved about living in the city. The world outside was always moving, always changing, but in times like these, she felt like she had a place to anchor herself, a sense of belonging to a routine.\n\nWhen they finished eating, Zhen helped Ling wash the dishes and then headed out to get ready for her walk. She tossed on a scarf and grabbed her old camera, deciding at the last minute to carry it with her. The sun was starting to break through the clouds as she made her way to the park, casting long shadows across the sidewalk.\n\nAs she walked, Zhen felt invigorated, her senses heightened by the crisp air and the sounds of birds singing from the trees. She walked for miles, taking in the sights and sounds of the city, pausing every now and then to take a photograph of something that caught her eye.\n\nEventually, Zhen's feet grew tired and she decided to head home, letting herself get lost in the rhythms of the city one last time as she drifted to sleep that night, lulled by the sound of water dripping from the faucet in the kitchen. She was content, knowing that tomorrow would be another day like this one, full of possibility and quiet moments of peace.  â€‹\nZhen walked, her feet carrying her along the winding path of the park without her conscious mind paying much attention. She had always loved this little park, tucked away in a lesser-known corner of the city. It was one of the few places where she could escape the cacophony of traffic and chatter that seemed to consume every other part of the city.\n\nAs she continued on, Zhen's gaze drifted to the trees around her. They were a riot of color, with leaves in shades of deep red, golden yellow, and fiery orange. The sunlight filtering through their branches cast intricate patterns on the ground below, like nature's own version of an abstract art piece.\n\nShe paused for a moment, standing still beneath a particularly beautiful oak tree. Its massive branches stretched out above her, providing a canopy of shade from the late morning sun. Zhen closed her eyes and breathed in deeply, drinking in the scent of the leaves and the earthy smell of the earth.\n\nThe sounds of the city seemed to fade away as she stood there, the only noise the gentle rustle of leaves in the breeze. It was moments like these that Zhen cherished, a sense of connection to something greater than herself that left her feeling calm and centred.\n\nAfter a few moments, Zhen opened her eyes and continued on her way, feeling more grounded and at peace with the world. She walked for another hour or so, taking in the sights and sounds of the park, and eventually made her way back to her apartment.\n\nAs she stepped inside, Zhen was greeted by the smell of food cooking on the stovetop. Ling was in the kitchen, chopping vegetables for a stir-fry. Zhen smiled, feeling grateful for the warmth and companionship that her roommate brought to her life.\n\nShe took a seat at the kitchen table, watching as Ling expertly stir-fried the vegetables. The aroma wafting from the pan was intoxicating",
