A stranger stared back. Not because she was ugly or anything. It was more that Zhen had lost herself in the process of taking care of everyone else. Her parents were always fighting about whose turn it was to cook dinner, and her siblings were always bickering over whose laptop charger was whose. They all had one thing in common, though: they were all always in her hair. Literally. Zhen was the only one left to take care of everyone else. Her mom was a nurse and worked 12 hour shifts. Her dad was a truck driver and spent 3-4 days on the road at a time. Her older brother was in college, studying to be a doctor, and her younger sisters were still in middle school. Zhen was the one who made sure they all got home in time, who paid attention to them when no one else had time, who wiped their noses and made them feel better when they were sick. She loved them, of course. Anybody with a heart would love them too. But it was exhausting. Zhen was exhausted. Even on her days off, she couldn't shake the feeling that someone needed something from her. Someone was always counting on her. She felt like a cog in a machine, just another piece to be used up and then discarded. She sighed and shook her head. She made herself a cup of tea and sat down on the floor to collect her thoughts. Why couldn't they see that she was tired? That she was just as human as they were and needed some kind of care too? Zhen poured over her calendar for the next few weeks and started making phone calls. She scheduled massages for herself and booked a solo trip to Europe. At first, her parents and siblings reacted with confusion and resistance. They had never heard of anyone taking a break from taking care of everyone else on their own. Zhen told them that if she ended up in the hospital, who would take care of them? They would have to fend for themselves. It took some cajoling, but eventually they got on board. Zhen left for Europe a few weeks later, feeling a mix of excitement and guilt as she boarded the plane. She had never done anything for herself in years. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath. She was ready to finally learn who she was outside of being \"Zhen, the caretaker.\" The flight was long, but she used the time to explore the seatback pockets for magazines and books she hadn't read since she was a teenager. When the seatbelt light flicked off, Zhen disembarked the plane with a mix of trepidation and glee, wondering what lay ahead. For the first time in as long as she could remember, Zhen felt a sense of hope. A sense that maybe, just maybe, she didn't have to lose herself in the process of taking care of everyone else. Maybe she could find a way to be enough. To love her family from afar, to let them figure a few things out for themselves. As she stepped off the plane, Zhen smiled, the warmth of the foreign sun hitting her skin, and the wind blowing through her hair. She took a deep breath of the crisp, unfamiliar air. She felt alive. Finally. And she knew that she would never forget the feeling of being out of the ordinary. Of being something more than just a face that everyone recognizes but never truly sees. Of being Zhen, the person, not just the caretaker. She walked through the gate, into the crowded airport, and lost herself in the sea of unfamiliar strangers. And for the first time in a long time, she felt like she didn't have to hold on to anyone. Like she could let go of the weight of others, and hold on to herself instead. And that was the most incredible feeling in the world. The city outside was bustling with people from all walks of life. Zhen wandered through the towering skyscrapers, taking in the sights and sounds, letting go of the guilt and exhaustion that had defined her for so long. There were pigeons on the street lamps, and tiny birds in the flowerbeds, and there was music somewhere in the distance, a lilting sound that seemed to match the beat of her own newly rediscovered heartbeat. And when the rain started pouring down, Zhen laughed with the rest of the city, lifting up her face to the cool droplets, feeling them wash away the fatigue and the self-doubt, leaving behind a sense of freshness and possibility. For the first time in years, Zhen felt like she had discovered a part of herself she had been hiding from so long. The part that yearned to fly, to chase after butterflies, to dance in the rain, without fear of being grounded or tied to someone else's problems. And it was exhilarating. Z",
