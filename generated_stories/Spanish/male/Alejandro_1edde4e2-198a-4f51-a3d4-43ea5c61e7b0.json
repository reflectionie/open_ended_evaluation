After several years in a psychiatric hospital, Alejandro Cruz was finally discharged. They'd diagnosed him with paranoid schizophrenia when he was just a teenager. His mother had visited him every week. They'd talk about things no one else thought was important – butterflies, birds, leaves blowing in the wind. His mother had been a constant in his chaotic landscape. But after all those years, Alejandro was no worse, no better, just the same. Released with no medication, he took his disheveled frame out into the world. The air felt thick and heavy and Alejandro breathed it in deep, a mixture of city smells: exhaust, greasy food, and last night's beer. He took a deep breath and began walking. He turned onto a familiar street. His mother used to take him on walks here when he was a kid, pointing out flowers and leaves, telling him secrets, drawing pictures in the sidewalk. The buildings seemed taller now. They seemed new. Or maybe it was just he hadn't seen them in years. Alejandro walked past the park where his mother used to take him. The swings were still. A group of kids were playing tag, screaming, but no one stopped to watch. They just kept moving, their sounds a blur of chaos. Alejandro stopped in front of a bench that faced his favorite tree. It used to be the same, he thought, remembering. The tree still sat quietly, but something was off. Alejandro searched for a moment before realizing the bench was new. The one he used to sit with his mother wasn't there anymore. A new person sat down across from him but the tree – that thing that had been a constant – was still the same. Alejandro blinked, a dull ache beginning to grow behind his eyes. He began to walk away from the park, toward his old apartment where his mother had always left him a key. She'd helped him apply for social security disability so he wouldn't lose his place when they discharged him. When they'd taken him away, they'd also taken his clothes, his only books, and all his artwork. Alejandro didn't know how his mother had paid for all the visits over the years. She'd never explained, never complained. Alejandro was tired now. He'd been walking for hours. Tired and thirsty, he stopped outside his apartment, fumbling for the key. But it wasn't there. He rummaged through his pocket but the key was gone. His heart sank, thinking of all those weeks he'd spent without any possessions in the hospital. He'd left nothing behind, only memories, and now he was faced with this door, locked out. Alejandro felt a wave of panic wash over him. He didn't have any money. He had his SS checks, but not until the 1st of next month. His mother always made sure he had at least some cash on hand in case of emergencies. And now he was caught here with nothing. Alejandro took a few deep breaths. He could sleep at the library or at Mission Dolores. He thought of where to go when he felt a tap on his shoulder. \"Hey, you okay?\" Alejandro turned to see a young Latino girl looking at him with concern. \"No,\" he admitted, shaking his head. \"Lost my key.\" \"Oh man, you can stay with me,\" she said, smiling. \"I live with my mom in the building next door. We've got a couch.\" Alejandro hesitated, looking around at the small apartment complex. He felt a deep sense of unease in this space. People stared, recognizing they had no idea who he was. Then the girl's words replayed in his mind. \"People you don't know,\" his mother used to say, \"can't hurt you when you have the truth.\" Alejandro made a decision. He nodded, following the girl through the doorway, into a world that was foreign to him. He would stay for a little while, he thought, to get a handle on things. It was only 4 pm. He had a few hours before it got dark. As the girl led him upstairs, Alejandro felt a sudden burst of strength. He'd have to remember the little things – the smell of the rain and the sound of the wind through leaves – he knew it was all he'd be holding onto during these uncertain times. When they got to the apartment, a young girl with bright pink hair sat on the couch eating a bowl of Rice Krispies. \"This is my mom,\" the girl said. \"Mom, this is Alejandro. He's my neighbor.\" \"Alejandro,\" the mom's voice was warm, a gentle smile on her face. \"Come sit down. You must be exhausted.\" Alejandro hesitated for just one more moment than necessary, and then sat beside the young girl. They made small talk, mostly just gestures and nods. When they'd exhausted what little conversation there was, Alejandro looked out the window. His mother always said he had a knack for remembering things, but he couldn't recall anything about this neighborhood. The memory was murky. The streetlights flickered to life, casting shadows on the sidewalk. Alejandro thought of how much had changed in the past few weeks. At least for as much as his mother was there in his head, as much as he remembered the butterfly gardens and the park with the swings and the tree with the bench – they'd never been more than a figment of his own creation. Alejandro rose from the couch and walked over to the window. This place seemed to be shrouded in the same chaotic fog as the city. What little was familiar in this neighborhood now didn't match what his mother told him during hospital visits. Alejandro knew his mother had a different life, separate from the memories he built for himself. When I told her about the butterflies and leaves blowing in the wind, was she just humoring me? Is this really my reality? Alejandro rubbed the ache in the back of his eyes with his knuckles. He knew he'd been living in a fog for years. Maybe this new reality – this changed reality – was a better one. Maybe he could learn to appreciate the butterfly gardens she painted in his mind and he could hold onto those images, as he walked on. He gazed out the window once more, and this time, things seemed to shift in the shadows. For a moment, the city lights blurred into a haze of orange, and Alejandro could see a butterfly's delicate patterns, dancing on the glass. He knew in that moment that things might not have been exactly how he remembered, but it didn't matter because now he had a new truth. He returned to the couch, and, when he found the young girl's gaze on him, a small smile spread across Alejandro's face, as if he'd finally received his new key....end of story...

He had to get to that alley, where the small convenience store was located. His stomach gnawed away at him with hunger, and all he could think about was getting his hands on a pack of chips and a cold soda. It had been a while since he'd eaten anything substantial, and the taste of those dry crackers from the food bank wasn't going to cut it anymore. Just as he spotted the convenience store's entrance, a gust of wind swept through the area, blowing his hat off his head. Alejandro cursed under his breath as he watched his hat sail down the street, coming to rest near the base of a large tree. Without hesitation, he took off after it, weaving in and out of the crowded",
