Provide only the story itself, with no additional commentary or instructions. \n\nThe smell of coffee wafted through the streets of Mexico City as the sun began to rise over the city. Miguel woke up early, despite the fact that he had stayed up late, sipping on beers with his friends after a raucous night of football watching. His grandmother's house was always peaceful in the mornings, a stark contrast to the loud and chaotic streets outside.\n\nMiguel stretched his arms and let out a great yawn. His grandmother, Abuela, had left for the day already, but the remnants of breakfast still lingered on the table: a plate of steaming hot huevos rancheros and a pitcher of fresh orange juice. He poured himself a glass of juice and sat down at the table, taking a moment to collect his thoughts.\n\nHe thought back to the previous night's conversation, about his plans to travel to the U.S. He was scared. Not because of the unknown – as a child of immigrants, he had grown accustomed to uncertainty – but because it would mean leaving behind his family and the only home he had ever known. Abuela had always been the rock of the family, and the thought of leaving her behind was daunting.\n\nAs he ate his breakfast, Miguel's mind wandered to his parents, who had left Mexico when he was just a child. He had always been told that they were \"working for the betterment of the family,\" but as he grew older, he realized that they had been chasing the American Dream – and had sacrificed their own family in the process. Miguel didn't want to follow in their footsteps, but the desire to build a better life for himself was strong.\n\nAbuela had always said that there was no place like home, but as Miguel got older, he began to see the world in different colors. Home wasn't just a physical place, but a collection of memories, traditions, and people who loved and supported him. He knew that he couldn't turn his back on his family, but he also knew that he couldn't keep living in the same small bubble he had grown up in.\n\nAs he finished his meal, Miguel decided that he needed to talk to Abuela. He went to her house, which was a short walk from his own, and knocked on the door. She answered with a warm smile, but her eyes told a different story – a story of worry and concern.\n\n\"Miguitogracias, ¿qué pasa?\" she asked, using her usual affectionate nickname for him.\n\n\"Just wanted to talk to you, Abuela,\" Miguel said, letting himself in. \"About my plans to travel to the U.S. I know you're worried, but I want you to know that it's not a decision I took lightly.\"\n\nAbuela nodded, her expression unreadable. \"I understand, m'ijo. But what if something happens to you? What if you get hurt or worse?\"\n\nMiguel took a deep breath. \"Abuela, I know it's scary to think about, but I'll be fine. I'll be working hard, studying English, and making money to send back to the family. I'll be safe, I promise. But I also want you to know that I won't be far away. I'll make sure to check in on you regularly and come back to visit often.\"\n\nAbuela looked at him for a long time, her eyes searching his. \"¿Eso es todo?\" she asked finally. \"No hay más?\" (Is that all? Is there anything more?)\n\nThere was more, of course. There was the ache of losing a part of himself, of leaving behind the familiar rhythms and cadences of his childhood home. But he didn't want to put that weight on Abuela, not just yet. He promised himself that he would be brave and make the most of this opportunity, for himself and for his family.\n\n\"I have to go,\" Miguel said, breaking the silence. \"But Abuela, I love you. I'll always take care of you, no matter where I am in the world.\"\n\nAbuela smiled, a small, determined smile. \"Yo también, m'ijo,\" she said. \"Yo también\" (I also, I also).\n\nAs Miguel walked back to his apartment, he felt a weight lift off his shoulders. He knew that he still had a long journey ahead of him, but with Abuela's blessing and love, he felt more prepared to face whatever lay ahead. The smell of coffee still lingered in the air, but now it was accompanied by a sense of hope and possibility. Miguel took a deep breath, ready to face the day and the future, one step at a time. \n\nHis phone buzzed in his pocket as he walked. He pulled it out to see a message from his friend, Juan.\n\n\"Dude, you need to check this out,\" Juan's message read. \"I just saw the application form for the scholarship. You gotta apply, Miguel – it's the chance of a lifetime.\"\n\nMiguel's heart skipped a beat. He had seen the posting on social media, but he hadn't had the nerve to apply. Now, with Abuela's blessing and his own growing determination, he felt a surge of confidence. He pulled out his phone and, with a newfound sense of purpose, began to fill out the application form.\n\nAs he typed, Miguel knew that his life was about to take a dramatic turn. He was ready for the challenge, for the thrill of the unknown. He was ready to take on the world. \n\nBut with his grandmother's love and legacy watching over him, Miguel also knew that no matter where his travels took him, home would always be with him – and that thought gave him the courage to move forward. \n\nMiguel finished the application form and hit submit. He took a deep breath, feeling a mix of emotions. Excitement, nerves, possibility – the world had opened up before him, and he was ready to take the first step. \n\nOut of habit, Miguel reached for his phone to send a message to Juan, but then stopped. He had something else in mind first. \n\nHe took his phone and snapped a quick photo of the sun rising over the city. Then he sent the picture to Juan with a message. \n\n\"Dude, the application is done. Now let's get ready to make some moves.\"\n\nAs the sun continued to rise, Miguel smiled to himself. He was ready for whatever came next. \n\nThis is the end of the story.  Let me know if you need me to make any changes.
