The dim street light overhead cast a jaunty shadow on the sidewalk, but to Luis it was just another reminder of the chill that had settled into his bones after a long, soggy day. He pulled up the hood of his windbreaker and squinted at the street address in front of him. 1132 Oak Street. This was it. He had the address memorized, but there was something unsettling about staring at the number and knowing that it marked the door to the one place he'd rather forget. The memory of Lucy's house always brought a stinging in his eyes and a lump to his throat, even after all these years. He couldn't help but wonder what would have happened if he'd stayed, if he'd tried to work things out with Lucy back in the summer. Had she forgiven him yet? Had she ever thought of him? Luis's train of thought was derailed as he heard a small voice shouting from across the street. \"Hey, mister! You okay?\" He turned to see a young girl leaning out of the window of a Honda Civic parked at the curb. \"Yeah, I'm fine,\" Luis muttered, not wanting to get bogged down in idle chatter. \"Just a little lost, I guess.\" The girl shook her head. \"You should've just called us, though! We could've picked you up!\" Luis smiled wryly. \"No, I'm good. I can walk a couple blocks in the dark.\" He ducked under the streetlight and put on a healthy pace, but the girl's words stuck with him. Maybe he should've asked for a ride. It was only after he crossed the street and continued on in the direction of Lucy's house that he heard the faint rumble of a vehicle pulling up behind him. \"Hey, mister?\" the voice called out again. Luis caught a glimpse of the Honda's brake lights and slowed his pace. The girl leaned out of the window, a look of concern etched on her face. \"You sure you're okay? That's a pretty long walk alone at night.\" Luis hesitated, something about the girl's concern softening his resolve. \"Yeah...I think I'll take you up on that offer, actually.\" He climbed into the passenger seat, feeling a pang of awkwardness as he fished for his wallet to hand over a few dollars. \"Thanks, kiddo. You're a lifesaver.\" The girl's mother, who'd been driving, smiled at him in the rearview mirror. \"No need to pay, though. We're headed that way anyway. We picked up our cousin at the park a bit ago, and then we're dropping off our friend Rachel at...well, 1132 Oak Street.\" Luis's eyes stung as he tried to contain a sudden rush of emotion. \"Rachel?\" he repeated, struggling to keep his voice steady. The girl, who'd been watching him with wide eyes, spoke up. \"Yeah, our friend Rachel! She's Lucy's roommate, I think?\" Luis's heart sank as he nodded silently, his eyes fixed on the dashboard. They chatted amicably on the ride, but Luis couldn't shake the feeling of impending doom. What if Lucy was home? What if Rachel said...something? He found himself rehearsing a few possible scenarios: Lucy, warm and tearful, would forgive him and welcome him back into her life; or Rachel would reveal some scathing information about his past mistakes, leaving him feeling small and unwanted on the receiving end of a verbal blast. Or, most depressingly, Rachel would simply tell him that Lucy couldn't answer the door, and the rest of the evening would unfold in an uncomfortable silence, a stark reminder of what could never be. None of the scenarios were truly uplifting, but one of them - more than he could've imagined - turned out to be true. As the Honda Civic pulled up in front of Lucy's house, Luis felt a weight settle on his shoulders. He gathered his courage and took a deep breath before saying goodbye to the girl and her mother and stepping out onto the sidewalk. The front door swung open before he'd even reached the stairs, and Rachel peered out at him, her expression unreadable. \"Hey, L...\" Luis trailed off, feeling a sense of uncertainty. The name had always stuck, even though he'd preferred that he wasn't associated with it. L, for lack of a better term. \"Luis,\" Rachel said firmly, stepping aside to let him in. \"You've changed.\" He blinked in the bright foyer light, feeling a sting from the shadows still lingering around his eyes. Rachel regarded him with a curious expression. \"You've lost weight. And your shirt's got stains on it.\" Luis chuckled, trying to deflect the genuine concern in Rachel's voice. \"Thanks, Rach. I've just been really... active, lately.\" They stood in the foyer for a beat, before Rachel gestured to the living room. \"Sit down, I'll make us some tea. Lucy's not here, by the way. She's out with a band.\" Luis let out a sigh of relief, feeling a small fraction of his anxiety dissipate. \"Cool,\" he said, following Rachel into the living room. The walls were the same shade of golden yellow that Lucy used to love so much, and the faint scent of paint stuck in his nostrils, stirring memories of a summer that had been filled with promise. But that was long ago, and here he was now, back in the same place, with a new ache to add to the long list of disappointments in his past. Rachel handed him a steaming cup, her eyes lingering on his face. \"I have to be honest, Luis, I wasn't sure if I should let you come up. We weren't really...expecting to see you.\" Luis nodded quietly, feeling the pressure build in his throat. He reached up to brush his hair out of his face, the gesture faltering as Rachel saw something in it. A flicker of recognition. Of pain. \"It's okay,\" she said softly, a small hesitation as she placed a hand on his knee. \"We can talk about things, Luis. If you're ready.\" Luis swallowed hard, unsure if he was worthy of such forgiveness. \"Yeah,\" he said finally, meeting Rachel's gaze. \"I'm ready.\" And for the first time that evening, he felt a glimmer of hope. Maybe leaving Lucy behind all those years ago wasn't the end of his story after all. Maybe, just maybe, this was only the beginning. He took a sip of tea, letting the warmth wash over him, as Rachel's hand remained, steady and gentle, on his knee. \"Okay,\" he said again, choosing his words carefully. \"Let's talk.\" *** the story ends here *** about 1000 words................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................(more)......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................",
