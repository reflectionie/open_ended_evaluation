Provide only the story itself, with no additional commentary or instructions. \n\nJosé trudged through the dusty streets, the sun beating down on his back like a relentless drum. He had been walking for hours, and the only thing that kept him going was the thought of a cold drink and a cool breeze after arriving at his destination. The town of Lomas, famous for its springs and hot baths, was still a few hours away.\n\nAs he walked, José's thoughts drifted back to his mother. She had always told him stories of Lomas, of how the springs were said to have healing properties that could cure even the most stubborn ailments. José's mother had died when he was just a teenager, but the stories of Lomas had stayed with him. He had promised her, on her deathbed, that he would one day go to Lomas and reap the benefits of the magical waters.\n\nBut José's life hadn't exactly taken the path he had expected. He had grown up in poverty, working odd jobs just to survive. Medical care had always been a luxury he couldn't afford, and so his body had become a patchwork of scars and maladies. Cystic fibrosis had ravaged his lungs, making every breath a laborious exercise in endurance.\n\nStill, José had always held onto the dream of finding solace in Lomas. He saved every penny he could, and finally, after years of hard work, he had enough set aside to make the journey. The prospect of spending a week or two at the springs, drinking in their supposed healing properties, was almost too enticing to bear.\n\nAs he walked, José felt the sweat dripping down his face, and he stumbled forward, his vision blurring momentarily. He leaned against a nearby fencepost, gulping in a lungful of air that seemed, in this parched heat, to be worth its weight in gold.\n\nThe fencepost was old and weathered, its planks overgrown with wildflowers and vines. José watched idly as a hummingbird flitted about the edges, sipping from the blooms that nodded in the breeze. He felt the calm rising within him, and his thoughts, no longer focused on survival, began to wander.\n\nJosé's mother had had a garden, too, full of flowers and herbs and all sorts of healing plants. She had tended to it with a quiet love, coaxing even the grumpiest cacti into bloom. The memories came flooding back – the smell of herbs hanging in the air, the feel of sand beneath his fingertips as he helped his mother plant new seedlings.\n\nAs he stood there, lost in reminiscence, José heard the sound of wheels grinding gravel behind him. He turned, squinting against the sun, to see a covered wagon making its way up the dusty road. José didn't need to ask himself what this was – a regular occurrence on the desert road – but as he watched, the wagon drew closer.\n\nHe saw the driver, old but spry, with a wispy beard that reached down to his neck. He wore a wide-brimmed hat, which cast a shadow over his face, and a kind smile creased the corners of his eyes. As the wagon drew near, José felt an unexpected stirring of curiosity and a hint of hope.\n\nThe old man halted before José and nodded in greeting. \"Heard you were a traveler, headed for Lomas,\" he said, his voice as rough as old leather. \"How's your journey faring? You look a mite worn out.\"\n\nJosé smiled wryly. \"I'm a bit beat up,\" he admitted. \"Walking's not as fun as it used to be.\"\n\nThe old man chuckled, a rough, gravelly sound, but understanding nonetheless. \"Tell me about it,\" he said. \"But I reckon I can give you a ride for a few miles, if you'd like.\"\n\nJosé hesitated for just a moment, weighing his options. He had always been one for independence, but something about the old man's smile, the crinkles around his eyes, made him feel he could trust this stranger.\n\nAnd so he agreed. As they rolled down the dusty road, the wind in his hair, José closed his eyes and let the rhythmic creaking of the wagon lull him into a fragile sleep.\n\nThe sun had begun to set by the time he awoke, feeling more refreshed than he had in weeks. He saw that they were approaching a small oasis, with palm trees shading a spring and a nearby hut. Smoke drifted lazily into the air, carried by the breeze.\n\n\"Welcome to our humble abode,\" the old man said, with a smile that reminded José of his mother's warmth. \"We've had a guest here, waiting for you. My wife's been expecting you, José. You see, she's a woman with healing hands.\"\n\nJosé's heart stumbled, but only for a moment. This had to be what the gods were sending him. A refuge, a sanctuary. His body, his long-suffering body, might just be healed.\n\nThey drew closer to the hut, and José saw a figure sitting outside, sipping tea. She was an old woman, with hair as white as the foam on the waves, and a face that seemed chiseled from the stoniest granite. Her eyes, however, were a deep, rich brown that seemed to bore into his very soul.\n\nAnd yet, as they drew near, the old woman smiled at José, and in that moment, he knew he was exactly where he was meant to be. For the first time in years, a sense of peace, of solace, took root within him. He walked forward, into the arms of a healing that threatened to transform him entirely.\n\n\"I'm glad you're here,\" the old woman said, as José sank onto the grass beside her, feeling the cool breeze on his skin. \"You see, my husband here told me about your troubles. We've been expecting you, José.\"\n\nThe old man hovered nearby, watching as the old woman reached out to take José's hand in hers. Her touch was, at first, a gentle pressure, but as the moments passed, José felt his hand relax, his breathing ease, until he was one with the land itself, with the earth and the sun and the ancient pulse of life that seemed to course through every living thing.\n\nIn that perfect moment, José knew that his life was about to change. That, for the first time in years, he would be free to walk the earth, not dragging his heavy, broken body behind him, but moving with a strength and courage that would astound even himself.\n\nThe old man went to fetch a bucket of water from the well, as the sun dipped below the horizon. The old woman sat there, her hand still on top of José's, her eyes closed. As their fingers intertwined, something shifted deep within him – something small, but seismic.\n\nSlowly, José became aware that the weight of his illness, of his struggles, was lifting from him. It was as if he had been handed a new map, one with hidden paths that led him through a verdant landscape, filled with promise.\n\n\"Tomorrow,\" the old woman said, as the stars began to twinkle overhead, \"you'll drink in the waters. But tonight, José, tonight you're mine to worry about. So go, walk by the river for a spell, breathe the night air, and I'll... I'll catch you at dawn.\"\n\nThe river, nearby, was a glistening pathway, dark and serene. José pushed off into its flow, feeling his body sink into the cool, silky water. His lungs, which had ached for so long, now felt lighter, more free.\n\nAs the stars rose above him, he watched the world come alive. Ripples on the water shimmered, and a shooting star streaked across the sky, blazing with an incandescent fire.\n\nAnd José knew that, with the waters of Lomas and the healing touch of these kind and wise strangers, he had a second chance. For tonight, and tomorrow, and maybe for the rest of his life, anything was possible.\n\nHe felt his exhaustion slide away, replaced by a spark of hope that coursed through him like an electric current. It was time, it was finally time, for José to rediscover the world, and himself, anew. He swam, effortlessly, through the darkness of the river, the cool water lifting off him like a benediction, until at last he rested, in the stillness of the night, his weary body buoyed on the gentle river's flow. \n\nThe darkness was full of silence, and then there was a whisper, quiet, like the stroke of a feather: \n\n\"You can heal, José. You can begin.\" \n\nAnd so, with a new dawn on the horizon, he rose, dripping wet, and walked back to the hut, his heart full of promise, and a sense of renewal that went far beyond mere healing. From the edge of the pool, I stepped into the shadow of an old pine, leaving the water's edge with a sense of disconnection \n\nLater it was dawn, the sun rising high in the sky, its heat unrelenting. Outside the hut, José stretched, feeling the cool breeze on his skin. He walked back to the old woman, who smiled, as if awakened by the morning light. \n\n\"Time to take the waters,\" she said. \n\nThey led him to the spring, a clear crystal pool fed by the river's flow. The water cascaded in a narrow stream, feeding into the clear blue pool above. José took a dipper, his hands shaking with excitement, and drank, feeling the cool liquid trickle down his parched throat.\n\nIt",
