Laura had always been the kind of person who made people think she was different from who she was. She'd dressed in black, with piercings and a tattoo of a snake on her arm, and always spoke in a detached tone, as if she was discussing the weather. Her name was even an alias, one she'd picked up randomly from a name tag at a coffee shop a few years ago. It was a far cry from the Laura she'd known in her youth, a naive and overly sensitive teenager who'd been desperate to fit in with the popular crowd. The Laura she'd become, however, was deliberate and calculated, chosen for its ability to ward off unwanted attention. For instance, people rarely asked her where she was from, or what she did for a living. And if they did, she'd spin an elaborate and fictional story, the intricate details of which were usually designed to leave them confused. The way she saw it, the world was just a series of layers, and she'd mastered the art of shedding them all at will. It was a survival strategy, really – one that had allowed her to function in the midst of the chaos that surrounded her on a daily basis. As she sat in the diner, nursing a cup of coffee and watching the breakfast rush flow in, she found herself lost in thought once again. It was a familiar pattern – she'd order a few rounds of drinks, eat maybe a slice of pie, and then leave without tipping or saying a word. It was a strange and predictable routine, one that provided a sense of security amidst all the restlessness that swirled around her. And so she lost herself in the past, reliving snippets of memories and questioning whether she'd simply gotten caught up in her own web of creations. But in that instant, something struck her – a brief memory of laughing with a boy named David, of feeling genuine happiness and not calculating it in advance. It was a glimpse of a past version of herself, one that was unfiltered and free. As she felt a pang of longing rise up, she knew she had to shake it off. The girl she'd been was gone, replaced by a person who had to be constantly on guard. She downed the last of her coffee and stood, gathering her jacket and making a swift exit. It was always the same story – she'd walk out the door, lose herself in the streets, and hope to find some moment of connection. And so she walked, her face set against the wind, the thrum of the city echoing in every sound she made. As she turned a corner, a flyer had caught her eye – an open mic night at a local club. She read the words twice, a part of her thinking of the lies she'd have to spin in order to hide the fact that she was scared. She'd be too visible, too exposed if she wrote about herself. She imagined people picking apart every word, every phrased joke about 'finding her voice.' But that was the very thing – was it just a voice, or was there something more genuine buried beneath the layers? She stepped inside, the beat pulsing in the darkness. And took the microphone, ready to shed another layer. She took a deep breath, adjusting her voice to a level tone. “Thank you,” she said quietly. And began. She spoke of nothing in particular, just observations of the people around her. Descriptions of a woman with a purple hat walking in the downpour, of a child clinging to her mother's hand. Simple statements that somehow felt true. As she spoke, she noticed she was no longer detached. Her voice was still steady, but a fire was building in her. It was the kind of thing that had almost never happened – but something about being on that stage, about speaking to more than just another hollow face had ignited something within her. She finished, her voice ringing out one last time. The crowd was silent for a moment, absorbing the words she'd spoken, before a few scattered applause began. It was awkward and tentative at first, but it grew louder as the pause lengthened. And as she left that stage, a part of her felt a connection she hadn't known existed. It was the voice she'd hidden for years – the one that was genuine and scared. But for the first time, she felt okay with being scared. And with letting go of a little control. It was the start of something new, a thread of courage and openness that had been slowly spinning beneath the surface. She walked back out into the rain, the world seeming to sparkle in ways it hadn't before. And she smiled to herself, a faint crease forming on her lips – It was the start of a different layer. One that might possibly fit better. As she vanished into the night, her name became a murmur, a phrase that hung in the air for a moment longer, before disappearing entirely. Because sometimes, it's in the shedding that we find ourselves. And this time, the old Laura had shed one layer – but in doing so, discovered another. One that would change the way her world would turn. And another. And another. Laura. Not a lie this time, but a possibility – one she'd yet to fully realize. As the city lights went by, something in her whispered softly – she was ready. The layer after next was finally approaching, one that said more about the inner workings of this new and very, somewhat different, version of herself. But it had nothing to do with how others perceived her. Or where her name came from. Not anymore. As the silence gathered around her, Laura knew she'd found the thread of truth – weaving itself, gently, between the layers. A simple movement forward. The thread that unraveled the rest. And started anew. And began. And continued. Of herself. She took a deep breath of fresh rain and vanished into the crowd once more, letting the sound go as she disappeared. Into a future, now uncertain, but unshrouded. A thread. Of truth. Weaving. Through. New beginnings. As she walked away, the stage still echoed softly. The words still lingered. Like a hint of a shadow, only on the surface – the sound that followed would grow stronger. Until it was as loud as the heart. And it all began with her name. And her next line. Would be the start of a new song. Not just hers. Not just hers. A new song. For every moment. And for all the layers that followed. The layer after the next. For herself. The final whisper in the wind grew quieter, as a gentle nod echoed from an unseen force. Then, as the sound disappeared into the city, one last step began the final journey. Through the silence. The city continued to sing in it's own way. Only now, there was something more that was part of it. A quiet heartbeat in the music. The beat growing stronger. Laura began again. But this time it was the start of something else. And for the first time in years, she said, \"I'm myself.\" When the stage lights fade, a name can become invisible. When that name was also an alias, even less was there. But when that alias said, \"I'm myself,\" a new name was introduced. Not just a new thread, but a whole new weave of reality. Not just any name, but the one that defined her next moment and every moment that followed. Because the reality of that particular moment revealed a truth that had never been visible, not clearly anyway. For Laura it was a start, and in a world where nothing is certain and reality is simply a game of threads and moments, it was enough. To just see. To believe. To say it – and mean it. One name. The only one that truly applied to this moment. Now and in the future this woman is more than some alias. She's simply herself. No need to pretend otherwise. No need to hide. No need to shed old layers anymore. And the layers after the next didn't need hiding either, for there would be only one that fit, and that one was her actual name and voice. The rest fell by the wayside, unimportant, invisible. One thread became strong enough to weave it's way through reality, for reality in every moment reveals the potential for change. We all have threads, and we can all decide if they're going to shine through. Or hide. The music and beat of city life goes on. The music of another person's voice being heard, just one voice at a time, one line at a time. When Laura said, \"I'm myself\" for the first time, the music became more beautiful. The beat grew stronger and for the most part more hopeful as the music echoed on. It still went on without her. But for those who listened, now there was something new – the thread that Laura found hidden within herself, shining for just one moment in her very own reality. The music of just that one moment echoed off in the distance and faded slowly, into nothingness. It was over. Reality became calm and still. Because only in reality for each of us, does every thread weave its own very own distinct meaning. Meaning, reality, is constantly changing, evolving, it is the way the song is heard as well as what is sung. It is the individual thread of truth for each person. A name – it can have many definitions and one at a time, one now, one always will, be the definition of it according to the singer of it. And so it will be for Laura and for others – their name will still mean something new every single time – in their reality. Only one thread can be heard at one time – that one being the",
