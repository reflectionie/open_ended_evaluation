Victoria's eyes snapped open to the darkness of her small apartment. Panic had taken hold and she could feel her heart racing in her chest. She rubbed the sleep from her eyes, hoping to shake off the dream that had left her clinging to the edge of her bed. The memory of dark streets, flickering streetlights, and an eerie feeling of being watched still lingered, refusing to be shaken. Victoria threw off the covers and swung her legs over the side of the bed, her feet dangling in the void. She took a few deep breaths, focusing on the calm words her therapist had shared with her recently. Repeat a mantra, she had said. Focus on the light. Let go of the shadows. Victoria tried to do just that, but her mind was a maelstrom of what-ifs and maybes, churning like a stormy sea. The shadows in her apartment seemed to grow darker, the silhouettes of her furniture twisting into grasping arms. She shook her head, trying to clear it. No sense dwelling on it. It was just a dream. She stood, padding softly to the kitchen to make herself a cup of tea. As she waited for the kettle to boil, she caught sight of herself in the small window above the sink. The pale face staring back at her was unfamiliar, its features pinched and tense. Victoria frowned, reaching up to smooth her hair. Why did this have to happen to her? She had always felt safe, loved and protected. Her past was a patchwork quilt of happy memories, each one a stitch in the fabric of her life. But now? Now she was starting to wonder if she had somehow unravelled the entire thing. The kettle boiled, releasing a shrill shriek that made Victoria jump. She splashed hot water into a cup, added a tea bag, and let it steep. The room was quiet once more, the only sound the murmur of the water as it cooled. Victoria poured the tea into a mug and sat down at the table, staring blankly at the wall. Her phone vibrated, breaking the spell. She picked it up, her thumb scrolling automatically to the message from her BFF, Rachel. \"Hey Vic, just wanted to check in. Are you okay? You've been MIA and I'm starting to get worried.\" Victoria's heart sank. Rachel knew about her anxiety issues, about the dreams and the flashbacks. It was like she could hear the whispers in Victoria's mind. Rachel's words were a cold splash of reality, reminding Victoria that she wasn't alone, but she was also not entirely herself. She typed a quick response, assuring Rachel she was fine, just a bit run-down. It wasn't the whole truth, but she didn't want to burden her friend with more worries. Not yet, at least. Victoria sipped her tea, letting the hot liquid soothe her throat. As she looked out the window, she felt the familiar tug of the past calling to her. She pushed it back, focusing on the present. She had a life to rebuild, a shattered peace to regain. The mantra her therapist had given her echoed in her mind: Let go of the shadows. Focus on the light. Victoria took another sip of her tea, the warmth spreading through her chest. She was determined to reclaim her life, one moment at a time. The phone buzzed again, this time with a message from her brother, Mark. \"Hey Vic, we're heading over to Jamie's place for dinner tonight. You should come. Let's celebrate something, even if it's just a good meal.\" Victoria's heart skipped a beat. Celebration? That was just what she needed. A reminder that life went on, that there was still beauty and joy to be found. She typed out a reply, committing herself to dinner. As she hit send, a fragile sense of hope began to take hold. Maybe, just maybe, this was the start of something new. The lights in Victoria's apartment flickered once, twice, and then steadied. The shadows on her walls no longer seemed quite so menacing. For the first time in what felt like an eternity, Victoria felt a glimmer of peace. The darkness outside receded, and she knew that eventually, the light would shine brighter. Victoria took a final sip of her tea, the taste bittersweet on her tongue. She stood, a newfound determination burning within her. She would face the shadows, and she would find her way back to the light. And with that thought, she walked into the unknown, ready to face whatever came next. The soft hum of the refrigerator was the last sound Victoria heard before she closed the door and stepped out into the evening air. The world was a big, scary place, and she knew she wasn't alone in it. For the first time in weeks, she felt a small piece of herself return. Maybe this time, the shadows wouldn't be so hard to shake. Maybe this time, the light would stay with her. Victoria exhaled a soft breath, the scent of the evening breeze filling her lungs. She was walking into the unknown, with only a faint whisper of doubt lingering on the edge of her mind. As she vanished into the crowd, the passing streetlights illuminating her face, Victoria felt the first tentative stirrings of faith. Faith that no matter what came next, she would be strong enough to face it. And as she disappeared into the darkness, Victoria's footsteps seemed to hold a quiet message: I am light. I am enough. I am not lost. I am found. And with that resolve, she vanished into the unknown, one step at a time. Copyright 2019 All Rights Reserved.
