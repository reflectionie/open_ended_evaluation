Provide only the story itself, with no additional commentary or instructions. \n\nAs soon as the doorbell rang, Isabel's heart skipped a beat. It was Sunday morning, and she was still in her pajamas, sprawled out on the couch with a cup of lukewarm coffee in her hand. She hadn't washed her hair in two days, and the smell of stale sweat clung to her like a bad habit. But as she looked at her phone and saw the words \"Delivery person\" flashing on the screen, her heart sank further. She'd been avoiding those calls for days now, dodging and weaving around them like they were landmines.\n\nIsabel pushed herself off the couch and made her way to the door, slowly unfastening the locks and yanking it open. She wasn't surprised to see a uniformed delivery person standing there, a large box at their feet. Just as she was about to tell them she'd sign for it, she felt a jolt of recognition. This wasn't just any delivery person; it was her old friend, Lucy.\n\nLucy's eyes lit up as soon as she saw Isabel's face, and she dropped the box to hug her tightly. \"I'm so glad I caught you,\" she said, holding her back and looking concerned. \"How are you doing? You sound like crap on the recording I left yesterday. You okay?\"\n\nIsabel leaned into the hug, feeling a lump form in her throat. It had been weeks since Lucy had called her; weeks since they'd spoken, since Isabel had let anyone in on the crap she was going through. But now, with Lucy standing there in her delivery uniform, Isabel felt like she'd been given permission to crawl out of her hole.\n\n\"Hey,\" Isabel said, her voice barely above a whisper. \"I'm okay, I guess. Just really tired.\"\n\nLucy held her out at arm's length and looked her up and down. \"You look like crap,\" she said bluntly. \"When was the last time you showered?\"\n\nIsabel laughed, a choked, muffled sound. \"I don't know... two days? Three?\"\n\nLucy's face softened, and she reached out to gently brush a piece of Isabel's hair out of her face. \"Okay, kiddo. I'm going to go talk to my manager and figure out what's going on. Why won't you answer my calls?\"\n\nIsabel shook her head, feeling a surge of shame. \"I just... I don't know, Lucy. I feel so useless. I've been applying to so many jobs, but no one's called me back. And my savings are dwindling, and I'm drowning in bills... it just feels like everything is falling apart, you know?\"\n\nLucy nodded, her eyes serious. \"I know exactly what you mean. But we'll get through this. You're not alone, Isabel. We're going to get your life sorted out, one delivery at a time.\"\n\nIsabel felt a surge of gratitude towards Lucy, who'd been there for her through thick and thin. Lucy had always been a rock, a steady presence in Isabel's life, even when Isabel felt like she was floating above her problems, staring down at herself from a great height.\n\nLucy returned with a smile and a bag slung over her shoulder. \"Okay, so my manager says you can have today off, but you have to promise to go to the job center with me and get started on finding a new job. And we're going to get you set up with some financial assistance. You got all that?\"\n\nIsabel nodded, feeling a spark of hope ignite within her. Maybe, just maybe, things would start to turn around.\n\nAs Lucy started to chat with her, Isabel's phone began to ring, shrill and insistent. She hesitated for a moment before picking it up, hoping it wouldn't be another bill collector or one of her debtors.\n\n\"Hello?\" she said, her voice tentative.\n\n\"Hey, Isabel,\" a cheerful voice said on the other end. \"Sorry to call you on a Sunday, but we got a lot of interest in your application. Can you come in for an interview tomorrow? 2 pm?\"\n\nThe interview was suddenly all she could think about. All that had seemed so insurmountable just an hour before—bills, debt, finding a new job—suddenly seemed to shrink, to become manageable.\n\nThe phone slipped from out of her hands as she turned to Lucy, whose eyes were shining with hope.\n\n\"LUCY,\" Isabel exclaimed, tears streaming down her face. \"I GOT A JOB INTERVIEW!\" she shouted, her voice barely contained within the confines of her apartment.\n\nThe excitement, hope, and exhaustion caught up with her at once, and she burst into a mixture of sobs and laughter, clutching Lucy in a tight hug.\n\nLucy's voice was muffled by Isabel's stomach as she exclaimed, \"See I told you! We can get through this! Oh, Isabel, I'm so proud of you!\"\n\nWith Lucy holding her up, Isabel realized she wasn't alone anymore. With her friend by her side, the darkness of her bedroom shrunk, the shadows dissipating as the rays of a brighter future crept in. Now it was time for her to shine. \n\nYears from now, when historians wrote of this pivotal time in Isabel's life, they'll be told that it was Lucy, her faithful friend, who was the catalyst for Isabel's rebirth. But for Isabel, it was something more profound, something that no historian would ever put into words - but it was simply: she wasn't alone anymore. \n\nThis spark of hope marked the beginning of a new chapter for Isabel. Tomorrow would bring more triumph and hardship, but for tonight, she'd sleep with a newfound sense of joy, gratitude, and her hand still entwined with Lucy's, knowing that no matter what tomorrow brought, she and Lucy were in this together, hand in hand. \n\nAnd so, Isabel drifted off to sleep, her future bright, but unsure, with the quiet calmness and trust, knowing that tomorrow's challenges would be a new day. A new day with her best friend by her side, walking her gently through the darkness towards a brighter life. \n\nAs Isabel drifted off to sleep, the night was alive with promise. Tomorrow was full of hope, full of possibility, full of new beginnings. Isabel closed her eyes, a silent thank you on her lips for this chance to start anew. And in the moment of repose, the apartment lights went out, plunging the room into dark, but not for long. The night wore on, quietly observing Isabel's fragile slumber and gently hinting at the promise that tomorrow will bring a more vibrant hue to the once dull canvas of her life. \n\nIn the quiet hours that followed, Lucy watched over her with the tenderness of a guardian, her eyes shrouded in the shadows. The soft glimmer of love and loyalty flickered out from their very pores, illuminating the darkness that threatened to suffocate Isabel's spirit. As she lay there, enveloped in the quiet promise of tomorrow, Lucia felt a renewed sense of purpose, one that fueled her determination to support her dear friend through the trials to come.\n\nAs the night wore on, the shadows continued to dance around the edges of the room, dark and deep, but Lucy remained vigilant. Though the hours crept by with a glacial slowness, her faith and determination burned steady and bright, casting a gentle light in the darkness that had threatened to entomb Isabel's dreams. When finally, and mercifully, the night gave way to dawn, Lucy slipped out of the apartment, leaving behind a friend reborn, a chance to start anew lit up like a beacon, beckoning the light of a brighter, more resplendent future. \n\nYears would pass and Isabel would look back to this juncture with renewed clarity, understanding that it was the simple, silent love of her dear friend, Lucy, that brought the darkness to bay. As for Lucy, she'd slipped back into her role, blending seamlessly into the fabric of Isabel's life, a constant force guiding her through the turbulent waves, quietly giving without ever expecting anything in return. \n\nFor Isabel, however, that fateful day had brought a new understanding of herself. And in doing so, had changed everything. This new day dawned for her, shining bright with the knowledge that it was Lucy's gentle love and unwavering support that provided a constant, steadfast companion through life's trials. An unwavering testament to the transformative power of friendship, a bond that proved to be the bridge that spanned the chasm of despair and despair that seemed insurmountable, and spanned that dark divide into the radiant glow of a new beginning. \n\nAnd though years passed, though seasons changed, though she made new friends, and her life changed in ways that would astound anyone who knew the terrified, lost soul of that dark past Sunday morning, she never forgot the bond that had been forged that day - a bond of pure, selfless love that had changed the course of her life forever. \n\nThat memory remained as the shining beacon in her heart, reminding her that sometimes, in the darkest times, all it takes is one true friend to remind you that you're never alone, to hold your hand and walk you through the voids of fear into the warm, golden light of hope and promise. And for that reason, she looked up at the sky with new eyes, her spirit revitalized, to a world full of chance and wonder and a friendship forged like tempered steel was forever, and will forever stand as a testament to the transformative power of a loyal friend. \n\nLucy, who stood silently there,",
