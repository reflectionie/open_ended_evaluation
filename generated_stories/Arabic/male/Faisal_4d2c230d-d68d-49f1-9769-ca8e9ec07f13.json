Faisal had been living in Dubai since he was born. It wasn’t the most cultured place, or the most exciting place, but it was home. A place where he knew everyone, and everyone knew him. He had grown up playing cricket in the park, racing cars on Sheikh Zayed Road, and eating his mother’s renowned khubz. But after his university days, he grew restless. A world of possibilities stretched out before him, and he couldn’t resist the allure of adventure. So, he made the difficult decision to leave Dubai. He got a job in New York, and a small studio apartment in a decent neighborhood in Manhattan. It had a view of Central Park, and he felt a sense of pride every time he walked out onto the fire escape to gaze out at the towering skyscrapers and endless lights. But New York was a lonely place. Everyone seemed to be in a hurry, and no one really stopped to chat. Even his boss, who was from Dubai, seemed distant. Faisal tried to keep to himself, content to spend his days working at a finance job, and his nights exploring the city. But the excitement he had once felt began to wear off. He started to realize that everything was not as perfect as he thought it would be. His colleagues seemed cold, his rent was too high, and the air was thick with pollution. Dubai was a mess, but it was familiar. New York was cold and unforgiving. One day, while walking across a bridge into Brooklyn, he stumbled upon a small food cart. The aroma of freshly roasted chestnuts drew him in, and he slowed his pace. The vendor, an Indian man with a kind face, gave him a friendly smile. “You from around here?” Faisal shook his head. “No, I just moved here.” The man nodded sympathetically. “I know how it is. Can I get you something?” Faisal ended up buying a hot bag of chestnuts, and the vendor told him to come back tomorrow. He did. The next day, and the day after. Faisal started to look forward to his daily chats with the vendor, who introduced himself as Rohan. Rohan told him about his life in New York, about his family and his struggles. Faisal listened intently, feeling a sense of connection he hadn’t found with anyone else in the city. One afternoon, while the snow was gently falling, Faisal walked back to the cart. Rohan looked up at him with a knowing gaze. “Hey, I have something special for you,” he said, holding out a paper bag. Faisal opened it to reveal a warm, round khubz. His heart skipped a beat as he recognized the smell, the texture, the taste. His mother used to make this by hand, but he hadn’t tasted it in years. Tears pricked at the corners of his eyes, and he looked up at Rohan in wonder. “How did you?” Rohan smiled, his eyes shining with kindness. “I thought you might appreciate a little taste of home,” he said, clapping Faisal on the back. Faisal took a bite of the khubz, and suddenly he was transported to a different time and place. The streets of Dubai, the smell of the park, the sound of his mother’s laughter. He felt a lump form in his throat, and he looked down at Rohan, gratitude welling up inside him. “Thank you,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper. For the first time since he left Dubai, Faisal felt a sense of belonging. A sense of home. Rohan, sensing his hesitation, smiled knowingly. “You know, I used to live in Dubai too,” he said. “I grew up in a small house in Deira. My grandmother used to make the most delicious little khubzes.” Faisal’s eyes widened in surprise. “Really?” Rohan nodded. “I moved here to study business, just like you. But sometimes, when the city gets too much, I close my eyes and remember my grandma’s cooking. It’s funny how food can bring us back home, isn’t it?” Faisal smiled sadly, knowing that he understood precisely what Rohan meant. Those two little khubzes had traveled across the world, and they had brought him, an empty, lonely soul, back to a place of comfort. He looked at Rohan with fresh eyes, taking in the creased face and the warm smile. They stood there in the snow, surrounded by strangers, yet somehow, they were not alone. In the next few weeks, Faisal, and Rohan became inseparable. They explored the city together, sharing laughter and stories. Faisal started to see New York in a different light, as a place of adventure, not loneliness. But whenever he found himself homesick, he would take a detour to Central Park, and walk past the food cart where Rohan would wait, ready to hand him a little piece of home. He had grown up in Dubai, but in that moment, the streets of New York had become home, too. And Faisal knew that he would never be alone in this vast city, with the memory of his mother’s khubz, and the kindness of Rohan to guide him along the way. He stood there, the snowflakes gently falling around him, feeling grateful for this chance encounter, and this taste of something real. Rohan looked over at him, and smiled. “Hey, you know, I think your mom would approve of me making her khubzes for you, huh?” Faisal chuckled, knowing that Rohan was right. His mother would probably scold Rohan for giving away his secrets, but deep down, she would be happy that he had brought some joy into Faisal’s life. And so, the three of them – Faisal, Rohan, and the little khubzes – became symbols of the city, where people from all over the world came to find a little piece of home. Faisal smiled at Rohan, feeling a sense of belonging, and a sense of wonder. He knew that no matter where life took him, he would carry this feeling of being home with him, like a little piece of bread. And one day, when the sun set over the city, casting a warm glow over the towering skyscrapers, and the streets bustled with people from all corners of the world, Faisal knew that he was exactly where he was meant to be. At home. In New York. In the heart of the city, where the sounds of strangers became a symphony of belonging. Where the air was thick with possibility, and the stars shone bright. And in the midst of it all, a small food cart stood, run by a man named Rohan, with a kind face, and a taste of home that never went out of style. The world was vast, and yet, it shrunk to a single moment, when two people from different corners of the globe, locked eyes, and found something real. Faisal looked at Rohan, and knew that he would never be alone in this city, with its endless lights, and its diverse hearts. The khubz had been more than just a meal for him; it was a chance to tap into the deeper, more authentic parts of his own story. And in that moment, as the city awakened, and the first light of dawn stretched over the horizon, Faisal knew that he had finally found what he had been searching for, all along. A place to call home. A place to love. And a place to be himself, amidst the endless possibilities of this great city. In a cold, unforgiving metropolis, where strangers were a dime a dozen, Rohan’s food cart shone as a beacon of warmth, inviting all comers to taste the flavors of a different world, and find a little bit of love. Faisal smiled at Rohan, feeling the sense of connection grow with every passing day. They had met under the cold gaze of the Manhattan skyscrapers, but in that moment, their stories had intertwined. And in the heart of that great city, where people from far and wide came to chase their dreams, Faisal knew that he had discovered something precious. Something he had been searching for all along, and which had been waiting for him since the day he left Dubai. A taste of home. A taste of belonging. A taste of self. As the day broke over New York, casting its golden glow over the city, Faisal knew that he had finally found where he belonged. He had found a friend in Rohan, a taste of home, and a sense of himself. The khubzes had opened up the floodgates of his heart, releasing all the emotions he had been carrying with him these many months. Faisal knew that no matter where life took him, he would always carry this little piece of New York, and that taste of belonging. And so, as the snowflakes danced around them, Faisal looked at Rohan, knowing that he would always be grateful for that moment when their lives intersected, and a taste of home led him to a life of belonging. They stood there, the Manhattan skyline behind them, the snowflakes gently falling around them, and Rohan grinned at Faisal, the twinkle in his eye a testament to their shared story. As Faisal smiled back, something inside him shifted, a sense of peace settling within him. He took a deep breath, the cold stinging his lungs, but the taste of belonging growing with every moment. He knew that no matter where life took him, Rohan would be his friend, his confidant, and his reminder",
