The streets that led to the Khan Market were never empty. Every day, he thought, a sea of people flowed through the boulevards, their footsteps pattering against the pavement like rain. Today was no different. Ahmed ducked between the hems of strangers, moving quickly, searching through the tangles of shoppers and vendors and tourists for a glimpse of the woman he needed to find. He knew she'd be hard to spot in the teeming market, but it wasn't the first time he'd been on this trail. Her name was Fatima. She was the reason he'd come to this city years ago, and the reason he was still here now. The stories said she had gifts – visions and healings and other things Ahmed couldn't fathom. It was a long shot, but for as long as he'd known Fatima, he'd trusted her to make sense of his life, to offer him some sort of direction. He shouldered his way through the crowds more aggressively now, more carefully than ever before, his eyes scanning the stalls and shops for a glimpse of the familiar silver scarf she sometimes wore around her neck. People shouted and laughed around him, but Ahmed's thoughts were singular: finding Fatima. Back when he and Fatima had first met in a small settlement in northern France, she'd told him about her healing, about how she saw into people's very souls and what was there in the darkness, what was hidden, what was lost. Ahmed had laughed, at first – her was the language of the gypsy women his grandmother used to tell stories about – but by the time he left the settlement, he was convinced. She had shown him things he wished she hadn't. His family. His future. A war that was still unfolding back then, but one Fatima seemed to know was coming even as they stood in the same village. He went back to see her in the dead of night, when the city slept, and the shadows were thick and soft. He'd wandered the streets for hours, finally spotted her from across the way – she sat in a small tea shop, her silver scarf around her neck, her eyes gazing into the street beyond their shop signs and advertisements, lost in some dream. She was lost in this moment too, lost in the ebb and flow of the crowds. He'd approached her, quietly, almost furtively, but when she looked up, she knew him. He knew it too. Her eyes still held that warmth that used to hold him steady, no matter how troubled his thoughts were. \"Ahmed,\" she said softly. He reached for her then, and her hand slipped through his, and though he wanted to hold her close, though he wanted to say, it's been too long, it was too soon to ask questions. They sat side by side for a moment, hands clasped together, saying nothing, just breathing together, watching the world flow by. \"Fatima, what's here?\" he asked after a time. The words just came, so naturally, as thought they were his life depended on understanding this. She raised her eyes to his, and in the flicker of those moments, he saw his family, his past, his future hanging together like a painting torn and pieced together a thousand different ways. \"Ahmed,\" she said gently, her voice like wind. \"My child.\" Now, even as the city thronged around him, Ahmed moved with a new sense of purpose. Fatima was here, and for a few moments, he was free. Free of everything else. The future. The past. His own desires. \"Fatima!\" Ahmed called out above the din of peddlers and vendors. The silver scarf appeared, a flash of brightness on a dull face. He'd found her. He ducked between two stall holders, rushing towards her, out of breath, out of time, out of the thought process that usually consumed him. Fatima turned, smiled, and their eyes locked. For a second, Ahmed forgot, everything else but her. \"Ahmed!\" Fatima raised her hands, held him by the forearms, and he did not resist. \"You're still here,\" she said softly. He leaned against her, resting for a moment in the safety of her touch. They held the street at bay together, held it still for a moment. \"Some things, yes,\" he said softly, into the silence between them. Fatima's hands were warm, gentle. She searched his face, asking no questions. And in this moment, Ahmed felt understood. The city flowed by, the night began to set in – and in this one, single perfect moment, Ahmed felt truly found. Even in time of chaos and uncertainty, for as long as Fatima was by his side, Ahmed felt a chance to catch his breath, and start anew. For the first time in years, he didn't have to scan the horizon for a horizon beyond. When they let go of each other, Fatima smiled, and said quietly, \"Tell me, Ahmed...\" and the world seemed to slow, for one step forward, in one very right direction. \"Tell me what?\" he asked softly, taking her hand once more, ready to answer whatever questions there were to come. With a gentle squeeze, he stepped into the noise and chaos and beauty of the night with Fatima by his side, and the city that they both called home at this moment was once again not a place, but the door to somewhere better. Where was Fatima taking him? To where he would truly find peace, or to where he would lose himself? Ahmed had only her hand to hold onto, and the promise of her presence beside him. He took a breath, then another – stepping forward, one single step. And into the city's evening chaos, into a thousand unseen possibilities, he began to move. With Fatima's hand in his own, Ahmed began to move forward. He had been chasing her for so long; maybe it was time to trust that she led him to the one place where he would find the answer: forward. Into this city, with the flow of people streaming around them, into the city's labyrinth of shadows and sounds, where love, hope, and loss and redemption, hung in each breath. Together they moved on into the night. For the first time in years – perhaps in his entire life – Ahmed took a simple step forward, without a map or a destination, or even a dream. He took a step, and then another, and with Fatima in tow, trusted that the next step would bring him to something new. And in this moment, Ahmed knew that, one step forward, he could face it all. \"A quiet alleyway between the big restaurants,\" she said, pointing a little way into the market. \"Follow me.\" They took the route through the alleyway, winding through it, Fatima ducking occasionally, and him, too. And the sounds and smells that usually overwhelmed him receded. \"It's a safe place,\" she said, her voice barely audible. \"A place to stop and reflect. Sometimes we need to pause.\" Ahmed followed her, down a dead-end street lined on either side by tall buildings that touched the sky. At the end of the street, they entered the quietest, coldest oasis Ahmed had seen all day. He and Fatima slid into the corner, against a white stone wall. \"You are not the only one who's been searching,\" she said softly, her words spilling easily into the silence now. Without looking up, without looking up for so long, he took her other hand too. The contact made his heart jump to life. \"Whose else?\" he asked, the noise of the city far, far away now. The city's sounds became almost nothing in the face of the question that lay between them. Her words were the first light of a new dawn, and in this quiet refuge, all the unknown mysteries began to make sense. For a while, they did not speak, not because they did, but because there was nothing to say. Until this moment, he would have guessed Fatima understood nothing he spoke, that he was simply going through the motions. But Fatima's hands held two truths at once, gently and without shame: he deserved love, and that he had it now, for the first time, truly now. For the first time in years, Ahmed trusted that she led him to the one place where he would find the answer: forward, to something new and full of hope. As Fatima watched him smile, she leaned in close for a kiss. In the cool stillness of the market, away from prying eyes and ears, Ahmed allowed himself to be kissed, at first tenderly, then more warmly, as if trying to thaw out the winter of years. When it ended, he didn't pull away. Fatima leaned back, looking into his eyes. And for a moment, it was as if she understood something – something that made her smile, too. \"Ahmed,\" she whispered, once more searching his face, yet not searching. \"Do you know what you're doing here?\" \"I came for you,\" he said softly, with a full heart, a complete heart. He pulled her close, and closed his eyes as he finally felt the world around him steady. \"I'm here,\" he added, feeling hope for the first time. They were side by side, now and for the first time. For a moment, it felt like they were together. For a long time now, Ahmed had carried the weight of his own future, of the family, the past, the responsibilities that he knew he was the only one to bear. Now, Fatima stood",
