Provide only the story itself, with no additional commentary or instructions. \n\nOmar sat on the beach, watching the sun set over the waves. He had been waiting for his grandmother to arrive for what felt like hours, or maybe just the past few minutes - time lost all sense of meaning when the sky changed like this. His feet were buried in the cool sand, and the breeze carried the scent of salt and seaweed through his hair.\n\nAs he gazed out at the sea, Omar felt the familiar ache in his chest. His grandfather had passed away just a few days ago, and his grandmother had come to stay with him for a little while. Omar's mom and dad were still dealing with their own grieving, and Omar felt like he'd been left alone to navigate this new, dark reality.\n\nHe thought about his grandfather a lot. He remembered the way he used to smell like wood smoke and old books, the way his eyes crinkled when he smiled, the way he taught him how to throw a hook with just the right amount of force. Omar missed him, and the pain of that loss felt like a weight sinking slowly into the sand beneath him.\n\nThe sun dipped lower in the sky, leaving a blazing streak across the horizon. Omar's grandmother walked into view, her silver hair shining in the fading light. She smiled when she saw him, and Omar's heart swelled with love and gratitude. He jumped up, dusting off the sand, and ran to her. They hugged tightly, Omar burying his face in the crook of her neck.\n\n\"I'm here, amor,\" she whispered into his hair. \"I'm not going anywhere.\"\n\nOmar felt a little better with her by his side. She took his hand, and they walked the beach, watching the stars start to twinkle in the darkening sky. His grandmother told him stories about his grandfather, about their life together, about all the adventures they'd had. Omar listened, his eyes wide with wonder, as the memories bloomed in his mind like fireworks exploding in the night.\n\nAfter a while, his grandmother suggested they go for a walk in the nearby town. They strolled through the quiet streets, hand in hand, taking in the sights and sounds of the sleepy evening. Omar's grandmother pointed out the old-fashioned ice cream shop, the one with the colorful parrot outside the window. Omar grinned, and they went inside to buy some cones.\n\nAs they licked the cold, sweet treat, Omar felt a small, tentative smile spreading across his face. He knew his grandmother was trying to take his mind off things, and it was working. The world still felt huge and empty, but with her by his side, he felt like maybe he could find his way through the void.\n\nThey walked a little further, until they came to a small park. There was a bench in the center, surrounded by trees and overgrown bushes. Omar's grandmother gestured to the bench, and they sat down together, holding hands once more.\n\n\"It's okay to be sad, amor,\" she said softly. \"It's okay to miss him. But as the days go by, the pain will start to fade. It won't go away completely, I don't think it ever does, but it'll become something you can live with.\"\n\nOmar nodded slowly, his eyes drooping as the fatigue and grief began to catch up with him. He leaned his head on his grandmother's shoulder, feeling the familiar scent of her perfume and the soothing rhythm of her heartbeat. For a moment, everything was okay.\n\nAs he drifted off to sleep, listening to the sound of the waves in the distance, Omar knew that his grandmother was right. He couldn't lose himself in the sadness forever. Slowly, incrementally, he would learn to carry it with him, to live with the ache of missing his grandfather. But for now, in this peaceful, moonlit moment, he just let go, trusting that he'd get through it, one small step at a time. \n\nIn the days that followed, Omar and his grandmother kept to a routine: mornings spent fishing with the old man's tackle box, afternoons reading together, and evenings walking the beach as the sun set over the waves. His mom and dad would glance at each other, worried still, but also relieved that their son seemed to be coping.\n\nAs they settled into this rhythm, Omar found himself growing more and more like his grandfather - quiet, introspective, but with a deep love for the natural world. He started to notice things he'd never paid attention to before: the way the fishing nets rippled in the current, the sound of seagulls crying overhead, the smell of saltwater on his skin.\n\nIt wasn't exactly like losing his grandfather had erased the pain, but it had shifted it, somehow. Omar felt his heart expand, like the tide coming in, to make room for the love and the memories of the man who'd started it all. He began to understand that his grandfather's legacy wasn't just what he'd left behind, but who he'd been, a living, breathing, complex person who'd loved Omar and his family with all his heart.\n\nOne morning, as they sat on the beach watching the sun rise, his grandmother pointed out a small, dark shape bobbing in the surf. \"See that, amor?\" she said, her voice barely above a whisper. \"That's a cormorant, one of your grandfather's favorites.\"\n\nOmar's heart skipped a beat as he gazed out at the water. He felt a jolt of recognition, a connection to his grandfather that was almost palpable. \"It's like he's still here,\" he said, his voice shaking a little.\n\nHis grandmother reached out, took his hand, and squeezed it gently. \"I think that's exactly right, amor. Your grandfather will always be with you, in your heart, in the memories you share with me. And we'll keep sharing them, every chance we get.\"\n\nAs Omar looked out at the sea, he felt a sense of peace settle over him. He knew he'd never forget his grandfather, not ever. And as long as his grandmother was there to guide him, to share the stories and the love, he'd keep moving forward, one step at a time, carrying his grandfather's memory with him, just as he'd promised.  Omar smiled, his eyes welling up with tears, as the sun broke over the waves, painting the sky with hues of pink and gold. And in that moment, he knew he'd be okay, that he'd find a way to carry the love of his grandfather with him, even in the darkest of times.  As the sun continued to rise, casting a warm glow over the beach, Omar and his grandmother remained seated, hand in hand, taking in the tranquil beauty of the early morning, and Omar felt a sense of peace wash over him, a sense that he was no longer alone in his grief.  And as they sat there, watching the waves gently lap at the shore, Omar knew that he would always carry his grandfather's memory with him, and that he would carry on his legacy, just as he had promised.  The sun climbed higher in the sky, casting a warm glow over the beach, and Omar and his grandmother sat in comfortable silence, surrounded by the peaceful sounds of the ocean.  As the day went on, the sun beat down on them, but they remained, content in each other's company, watching the world go by from their little corner of the beach.  The waves continued to roll in, each one carrying a piece of his grandfather's memory with it, but Omar was ready to face it, to carry on his grandfather's legacy, to keep his memory alive, and to create new memories with his lovable grandmother.  The sea air filled with the cries of seagulls, and Omar smiled, feeling a sense of peace and contentment wash over him.  He knew that he would always carry his grandfather's love with him, and that he would continue to honor his memory in every way he could.  And with that thought, Omar stood up, brushing the sand from his pants.  He wrapped his grandmother in a tight hug, holding her close as the sun beat down on them.  \"Thank you for being here with me, abuela,\" he said, his voice barely above a whisper.  \"I don't know what I would do without you.\"  His grandmother's eyes welled up with tears, and she held him close, her voice trembling with emotion.  \"You'll never have to find out, amor. I'll always be here for you.\"  And with that, they stood there, wrapped in each other's arms, watching the sun rise over the ocean, a reminder of the love that bound them together, a reminder of the memories they would create, and a reminder of the grandfather who would always be with them, in spirit.  As the day went on, Omar and his grandmother continued to sit on the beach, watching the world go by, their hands intertwined, their hearts filled with love, and their spirits at peace.  The sun continued to shine, casting a warm glow over the beach, but it was nothing compared to the love that Omar felt in his heart.  He knew that he would carry on his grandfather's legacy, that he would honor his memory, and that he would always be grateful for the time they had shared together.  And with that thought, Omar stood up, brushing the sand from his pants.  \"Abuela, can we go get some ice cream?\" he asked, his eyes sparkling with excitement.  His grandmother smiled, her eyes shining with tears.  \"Of course, amor. We can get all the ice cream we want.\"  And with that,",
