Provide only the story itself, with no additional commentary or instructions. \nFor an instant, Zeyad closed his eyes as the bus swerved to the left, jolting him against the doorframe. He opened them again when the wheels stabilized, the engine still roaring as the bus hurtled down the highway. He had given up trying to catch his breath months ago.\nThe bus's vinyl cushions were torn at the edges, the seats creaking with each movement. Across from Zeyad, a young woman stared blankly at a tablet screen. Zeyad's gaze drifted to the girl clutching her doll in the aisle beside him. She stared back, her wide eyes like two shiny olives in her small, dark face. Occasionally, the mother sitting next to the girl handed her a tiny snack or whispered something into her ear, but mostly the girl just watched Zeyad.\nHe tried not to make eye contact, but it was hard. People were more interesting when they weren't looking at him, but these strangers had a way of gravitating toward his face. He'd grown accustomed to being the center of attention, but it still felt like a trap. Zeyad turned to the window and pressed his forehead against the cool glass as the city blurred by. The girl in the aisle watched as his eyes followed the blur, and Zeyad felt a twinge. He opened his eyes, and the girl nodded slightly as if to say, \"Ah-ay's all right,\" before looking away.\nOutside, buildings gave way to billboards and then nothing at all: vast expanses of desert, then rocky outcroppings. The landscape shifted like quicksand. Zeyad spotted a group of birds, their silhouettes stark against the blue horizon, but they vanished into thin air. The bus continued on, spewing smoke into the pristine air. Zeyad felt the familiar feeling of loss creeping in. It was like the world was pulling away from him, forcing him farther and farther down a road he couldn't recall taking.\nA faint scent of smoke hung in the air when Zeyad stepped out into the blistering heat. He squinted, squinting some more against the sun's glare. The desert stretched out before him like a vast gray sheet of stone, punctuated by the occasional cactus. Zeyad took a deep breath, letting the heat seep into his lungs. His mouth was parched, and he knew he was overdue for a drink. On the bus, he'd seen a water bottle lying abandoned on a seat; now it occurred to him that he'd left it there.\nHe glanced around, looking for the bus – it was nowhere to be seen. Zeyad turned back toward the only structure in sight – a small shack that seemed to lean precariously into the wind. Paint peeled from the door in long strips, the word \"Rest\" scribbled in crooked letters across the entrance. The sign swayed back and forth, a mocking gesture. Zeyad approached the shack, walking at a slow, deliberate pace.\nAs he reached the door, it swung open, and a man with a thick beard emerged. Zeyad took a step back, surprised, and the man regarded him calmly. \"Water?\" he asked, his voice like sandpaper. Zeyad nodded, taking another step back as the man turned to disappear into the shack. The girl in the aisle flashed through Zeyad's mind, but the image was fleeting. He concentrated on the man, who reappeared with a canteen and a wisp of dust clinging to his face.\nZeyad took the canteen, holding it in his left hand while he screwed off the lid with his right. A few sips slid down his throat, cooling his parched skin. When he handed the canteen back, the bearded man hesitated, then nodded in approval. \"You okay?\" he asked. Zeyad shrugged, unsure how to respond. He'd expected something – an interrogation, an explanation, something – but the man simply regarded him in silence. Zeyad felt a jolt of unease and then a pang of gratitude. He didn't know this stranger, but for a moment, he felt an overwhelming urge to tell him everything.\nBut instead, he shrugged and said nothing. Maybe because he didn't know what to say, or maybe because he didn't know who \"he\" was. The man handed him a worn-out map, with a crude arrow pointing westward. Zeyad blinked at the blank page and the arbitrary mark until the man leaned in, his eyes narrowing into slits.\n\"You're walking?\" he asked. Zeyad nodded, though it was a silly thing to do – of course he was walking. This was the only option. When he looked up, the man's expression had changed. For a moment, for the first time in months, Zeyad thought he saw a glimmer of recognition. The man's eyes widened, and for the briefest second, his face seemed almost – almost – familiar.\nBut the moment passed, and the bearded man stepped back. The air was quiet, and for a beat, Zeyad sensed something flickering on the periphery of his perception. Something he couldn't quite place or recall. When he looked up again, the man's expression was back to neutral, as if he'd never seen Zeyad before in his life.\nZeyad took a deep breath, then nodded and set off across the desert, the bearded man's footsteps fading into the distance. He watched over his shoulder, half-expecting the man to call out, but his silence was like a punch to the stomach, driving him forward with greater speed.\nAs the landscape stretched out before him, blank and unyielding like the map, Zeyad realized that he had two paths to choose from. The road led into the horizon in both directions. He took the one pointing westward, feeling an invisible force urging him toward the unknown. But every step he took, every stone beneath his feet, felt like he was walking backward – away from some memory that lingered just out of reach, away from a truth he couldn't quite recall but felt hovering at the edge of his mind. The desert stretched on and on, an unending, endless vastness that seemed to be pulling him further down the road, deeper into an invisible crevice where time and memory were slowly slipping through his fingers like sand. Zeyad walked, a lonely figure disappearing into the dust. \n\n(Note: This piece was created using a writing prompt, but the prompt is not included here.

The last thing left behind was a fragment of his thought, floating like a paper airplane on the wind –. end of story. the bus, he thought, or rather, his eyes thought – a fleeting vision of the interior, of the girl clutching her doll, her mother's smile – Zeyad's vision cut short by the blurring desert landscape and the thought dissipated into nothingness. \n\nBut for a moment, just a moment, it seemed like he might turn back. The bearded man's curious gaze seared itself into his memory, and Zeyad felt his foot dragging – an invisible current tugging at his ankle. To return, though – back to the city, to the bus, to the familiar hum of strangers he knew – an idea that dawned on him like a morning fog.\n\nFor the first time in months, it seemed possible that the answers might not be somewhere out there – but somewhere back here instead. Where memories resided – if they'd ever resided anywhere at all. The desert receded, its emptiness receding with it, and for an instant, it was as if Zeyad stood outside his own story, watching it play out like a series of disconnected scenes.\n\nAnd yet, even as doubt kindled a spark within him – a tentative whisper that he might, just might – remember something – that fleeting sense of recognition withered as quickly as the sun in morning's first light. Zeyad's shoulders slumped beneath the weight of what was left, and the landscape reasserted its dominion, the familiar sensation of a door closing behind him in time, leaving nothing beyond but an endless expanse of dust. The wind died down, and all was left still –  As the last grains of dust settled around him, Zeyad vanished from view, leaving behind the memories, and then nothing at all. end of story.) \n\nHe reached the crest of a small dune, paused for a moment, and took a deep breath of the pungent desert air as the sun rose over the horizon. To his left, a huddle of creosote bush glistened like a splash of paint in the early light, and he spotted a small clearing he'd missed before – some makeshift camp hidden amongst the scrubby plants. Footprints crisscrossed the dry underbrush, telling him that others must have been here recently. He didn't feel a rush of excitement or even much of anything, really – but he walked towards the clearing nonetheless.\n\nAt the center of the clearing stood a wooden shack that looked like it might have been salvaged from a junkyard and cobbled together by some enterprising soul. Zeyad approached cautiously and caught sight of a figure slumped against a nearby boulder, hands tangled in the creosote stems. The figure slowly lifted its gaze and met Zeyad's, offering a tired nod in greeting. For a minute or two, they simply",
