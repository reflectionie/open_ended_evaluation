Zeyad had always dreamed of flying. As a child he would spend hours watching airplanes soar through the skies, imagining the freedom and exhilaration that came with leaving the ground behind. But it wasn't just a hobby – Zeyad had a deep-seated fear that kept him rooted. A fear of heights. He would laugh it off with his friends, telling them he was just being cautious, but the truth was he was terrified. \n\nIt wasn't until his late twenties that Zeyad's chance to fly finally came along. He had landed a job as a maintenance engineer on an air show circuit, responsible for making sure the planes were in top working condition before the pilots took to the sky. It was a job he was perfect for – meticulous, detail-oriented and always prepared. But what none of his colleagues knew was that every time a plane prepared for takeoff, Zeyad found himself frozen with anxiety. He would stand on the sidelines watching, pretending to inspect the aircraft while his colleagues began the pre-flight checks.\n\nBut one day, something changed. As a routine check revealed a faulty propeller on an old biplane, Zeyad's supervisor asked him to test it out. Alone. In the cockpit. With the engine running. The pilot in question was an old-timer, not much over 50 years old, and he had flown those wings since they were new. Zeyad, still frozen, shook his head. But something caught his eye – the old pilot's logbook, lying open on the workbench. Logbook, dated 1985, was scrawled in the corner of a photograph – one taken on a runway, with a wide grin and two gleaming propellers in the background. Zeyad took a step forward, and the pilot, noticing, nudged him gently. \n\n\"Pitfalls of the trade, kid,\" he said, smiling knowingly. \"Wings you've seen so many times, sometimes they're not what they seem.\" He nodded towards the biplane, whose propeller was, by now, spinning lazily. \"Come on, let me show you what it means to fly.\" Zeyad hesitated, his heart thrumming with fear. But something about the pilot's words stuck. Somewhere deep within, a spark of courage flared. He took a deep breath and stepped towards the biplane.\n\n\"Okay,\" he whispered to himself, though he knew the pilot was listening.\n\nThe pilot handed him the headset and, one by one, the safety harness buckles were secured. Zeyad felt a cold bead of sweat trickle down his temple. He looked up at the sky, still spinning. He took a step forward, and another, until he reached the cockpit of the biplane. As the old pilot gestured for him to climb in, something else hit Zeyad. The biplane's cockpit, with the worn leather seats and a smudge of carbon on the instrument panel. The smell of hot metal and fuel. Something in Zeyad changed; he remembered a trip to his grandfather's old workshop as a child, where the smell of carbon and cast iron filled the cramped, grimy space. \n\nA sensation of familiarity washed over him. The rust on the biplane's tires. The worn wings. The biplane itself, the worn wooden seats... The same smell, the same... He looked up at the pilot still waiting beside him. And something in his expression softened. \"You know what?\" he said, looking calmly at the pilot, \"let me do it.\" \n\nThe pilot nodded, eyes never leaving his, as if seeing Zeyad for the first time. He took the headset and stepped outside, disappearing from view.\n\nA beat of silence fell over the makeshift hangar. Then, from beyond the biplane, came a faint whistle. A laugh. Encouraging, gentle. \n\nZeyad swallowed hard and reached inside his jacket, feeling the tension knot in his chest. His hand came out with a small pack of cigarettes and a lighter – like his grandfather's workshop. Where did it come from? Unlikely. A few of these stuck away with a bit of tape from his last project. He took the lighter, the weight reassuring in his palm. \n\nAnd began to climb in. Not exactly a smooth move, but smooth enough. He settled in, feeling his palms against the worn leather seats. The feeling was not of tight confinement, but almost... like slipping into an old friend. The worn wooden frame of the biplane, the instrument panel. Not like, but. The engine still roaring lazily behind him. \n\nFor one moment, time seemed to catch in his chest.\n\nHe closed his eyes and let his senses take in the familiar rhythms and scents, feeling the cool, grey air on his skin. From out came the whistle once more. He turned to see the pilot still watching, smiling knowingly from the same spot on the walkway, arms crossed.\n\nZeyad took a step forward, as one might push onto the porch, toward a part of his life he had kept hidden. Steadying himself on the harness, his thumb brushing against an old, hand-gritted handle of a throttle beneath the worn leather seat. A very familiar, utterly worn handle...\n\nHe opened his eyes, and in doing so, saw the world anew.\n\nWith a faint hum of excitement from within, a gentle, calm voice whispered in his mind. \"Just once, huh?\" And he started the engine. Felt the hum of vibrations, the gentle push... Then took a deep breath and pushed his shoulders back into the seat.\n\nSlowly, the biplane began to creep, in the faint scent of gasoline and burnt dust...\n\n\"Turn,\" the piloted was still shouting back through the headset, when Zeyad finally, suddenly, felt the first jolt of wind...\n\nA smooth, level acceleration came first then, almost before he could remember what movement in this was like; an urge, to leave. The seat harness locked tight, he watched, wide-open, in the faint sight of the old biplane's wooden frame as he began to glide across the concrete strip, as if by instinct, guided.\n\nAir pressure built with ease. Traction came. So smooth...\n\nA tiny hesitation flickered behind his face. Zeyad opened his mouth and let out a breath, in that moment feeling his chest contract. No rush of dread. No panic. A curious freedom had spread in his chest and down his spine, for a second, leaving... Zeyad realized that all his imagination had been a mere shadow compared to the true, warm scent, the feeling of flying itself. \n\nIt wasn't the dream of soaring the skies that finally broke the wall of fear; Zeyad realized that he was already in flight, feeling the wind, feeling the freedom. As the wheels kissed the runway and the biplane finally lifted off into the sky, a wave of calm flooded Zeyad's body. He gazed up at the old pilot, beaming as he disappeared into the distance.\n\nTime itself became fluid.\n\nTime to realize that, even with his legs on solid ground, a part of Zeyad's soul was soaring free, still locked in the rhythm of that engine. As it came to rest, for just a second before coming to rest at a safe distance, Zeyad knew – flying wasn't something he had dreamed of anymore; it was where he was meant to be.\n\nThis change... felt like an old friend coming home.\n\nAnd Zeyad just sat there on the biplane's wing, his eyes fixed into the far blue as the roar faded into a gentle purr, ready for anything. In a way.\n\nFor just a moment, everything was possible. The old biplane's controls had found a new pilot. As he raised himself up and stood for the first time, his weight, for a moment, steady on the worn leather seat, still wearing a small cloud of fear but no terror; feeling steady on the ground and in the breeze, just beneath the worn plane – now and always, it was within him. Zeyad then took that step off, onto the walkway beside the hangar. The old pilot's whistle from beyond. In that moment of pause before smiling back with newfound reassurance, as his new companion... Zeyad closed his eyes, listening for only the gentle hum of that old engine. He knew – he had finally found where he belonged. A newfound peace seeped into him as the breeze caressed him. Then the silence that waited within – Zeyad finally smiled to himself, before smiling back at the old pilot.\n\n\"I think I'll join you tomorrow,\" he said, his voice a little clearer, stronger.\n\nAnd then Zeyad began his walk into the clear, sun-blighted morning, just another step closer to being home. He stepped past his colleagues and onto the wind-blown tarmac, as if he had left a part of himself still locked inside that plane, but no way that had any grip on his feet or his stride. He took a breath of the warm air and looked up – not to soar into the skies – but to face the horizon. With a newfound freedom that lay far behind... The walk itself had changed. But nothing else. Nothing else needed to. Because from that moment on, Zeyad would walk the world, not on his fears anymore, but with his heart free on the wings.  The world unfolded itself, a little at a time, as Zeyad made his way towards the airfield. His feet pounded the tarmac in time with the hum of the engine, which had finally subsided to a gentle purr. The old pilot still watched him, a knowing",
