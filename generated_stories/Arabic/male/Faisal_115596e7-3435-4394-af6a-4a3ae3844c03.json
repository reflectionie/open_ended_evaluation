Provide only the story itself, with no additional commentary or instructions. \n\nFaisal waited outside the hospital, smoking a cigarette in the chill of the evening. The neon sign above the entrance cast a gaudy glow on the deserted street. It was late, and he had been waiting since before sunset. His mother was in labor, and he had to be here to meet his sister. Faisal took a final drag on the cigarette, then flicked it away.\n\nHe stepped inside, his eyes scanning the crowded waiting room. It was a blur of anxious parents and the occasional medical professional rushing to attend to some desperate crisis. Faisal was here to support his mother, and he also needed to receive news about the birth. Some people passed by him without as much as a glance, while others nodded or offered an awkward smile.\n\nAs he waited, Faisal's thoughts drifted to the conversation he had with his mother just the day before. Her words still echoed in his mind, and he replayed the exchange like a stuck record. His mother had asked him to help her, to be there for her during the birth of his sister. Faisal wanted to promise her that he would stay, to reassure her that he would be strong, but there was a hesitation within him. He didn't know if he could manage it by himself, or if he would collapse under the pressure. His mother's gaze had softened, but he knew she understood his fears. She had always been like that, able to sense his emotions, even when he thought he kept them hidden.\n\nFaisal snapped back to reality as the sound of his name was called. \"Faisal! Your mother is ready to meet you!\" It was the nurse, a kind-faced woman with an air of gentle assertiveness. Faisal stood up, taking a deep breath as he moved towards the corridor that led to the maternity ward.\n\nHe found the room they had chosen for his sister's birth. The hospital had been clean and modern, with private rooms that offered the families the comfort they needed. Inside the room, Faisal saw his mother lying down, her face tight with concentration. His father sat beside her, his eyes closed and his forehead twisted in an expression of concern.\n\n\"Faisal is here,\" the nurse announced quietly. Faisal saw the relief in his mother's eyes as he entered the room. She smiled weakly, her eyes locking with his.\n\n\"I'm here, mom,\" Faisal said, taking her hand in his. He squeezed it, trying to reassure her, but her grip on his hand was tight. His mother's face flushed, and she let out a deep breath. \"I'm ready,\" she whispered.\n\nThe nurse nodded knowingly and stepped outside the room. Minutes passed, during which Faisal held his mother's hand and offered her words of comfort. The sound of a baby crying filled the room, and his mother let out a gasp of joy. Faisal felt his heart swell with happiness and love for his new sister.\n\nWhen the nurse re-entered the room, a tiny bundle of joy was placed in Faisal's mother's arms. The little baby let out a soft cry, but the sound was somehow endearing. Faisal's heart tugged, and his eyes grew heavy with emotion. He felt a sense of love that he had never felt before.\n\nThe mother smiled up at him, her face flushed with happiness. \"Say hello to your new sister,\" she whispered.\n\nFaisal took a step back, his eyes fixed on the little head nestled in their mother's arms. Tears pricked at the corners of his eyes as he struggled to comprehend the change that this moment had brought to his life. It was as if the floor had slipped away beneath his feet, leaving him with a new sense of wonder.\n\nHe took a slow step forward, feeling a hesitation that had nothing to do with fear anymore. Faisal knew that he could face the next stage of his life, not only for himself, but for his sister, for his mother, and for his family. As he moved closer to his sister, Faisal knew that he was ready to be a part of this new journey with his mother, his new responsibility as an older sibling and a witness to his little sister's first few hours, and the memories that would unfold for him. He smiled when he touched the little hand that held his mother's, the first of a new generation of people who loved him, loved him by their very presence in the room.\n\nThe nurse handed the mother a warm towel, which she wrapped gently around their new daughter. \"Time for a first photo shoot,\" she joked as she smiled kindly at them.\n\nThe father stood up, helping Faisal to a better position to look at his newborn. For the first time, Faisal's hands shook, releasing a small sound, and tears began to fall from the corners of his eyes softly. This was the world that their mother had been waiting for so long – for a new life.\n\nFaisal smiled from the depths of his soul, trying not to let his emotions get the better of him. \"This is it,\" his mother whispered. He nodded silently. Their family had grown in just a few hours, and this time, it started with little steps into life's story. Their mother smiled weakly, exhausted but peaceful, and with tears that streamed softly as she gazed upon her new child. He understood that this was his turn to stand there and witness this miracle, and for that small moment, everything felt right with the world.\n\nAs they took the photos, their mother gently cradled her newborn baby girl. Faisal watched over his mother as she gazed at the photo of him with his new baby girl. His heart swelled with emotion watching his mom, as he wondered about the years ahead.\n\nHe leaned down, placing a firm kiss on his mother's forehead. When the kiss was over, Faisal wrapped his hands around her mother. And in this tiny, fragile, helpless moment, all the doubts he'd had melted away, lost in the beauty and love that filled his mother's eyes in their first moments as new mom and dad when holding onto this little bundle of fresh breath that the hospital cradled within its new heartbeat inside his heart.\n\nThe world outside the hospital room was waiting, full of challenges and joys he was yet to discover. He whispered something to his mother, his words muffled with a kiss on her hair. \"I'll always be here for you and her, mom.\" He felt a strange sense of belonging wash over him in that silent moment – for his sister and his mom. For in that moment, he was reminded that family was more than just blood – it was a bond that was unbreakable. And with that, Faisal knew he would face the years ahead with courage, with his heart full of love and a brand new identity as a big brother.\n\nThe nurse re-entered the room with a beaming smile, \"Your newborn daughter is now cleared for discharge,\" and with that, Faisal knew that his family's journey was only just beginning. The room, once filled with the sounds of machines beeping in the background, now felt filled with something new. The newborn cooed and reached for her mother in a tender gesture that cut deep into Faisal's soul – it was love. The nurse gently wrapped them up, so as not to startle the fresh, still tiny body that nestled in her mother's new warmth. Faisal's little sister's tiny fist closed tightly – she had let go of the world for the first time. And with this fragile little heart beating, a new generation entered this world that was full of possibility and full of love. Faisal knew that his story had changed, that the events unfolding here were not just a family, but a generation of love unfolding for him and his new sister.\n\nThe nurse handed Faisal the hospital gown. It felt soft in his hands. Faisal let go of his mother's hand, and followed the nurse outside to bring his little sister home to begin their journey together as a family. Faisal knew now that tomorrow would bring a new day, when his family would no longer be restricted within these walls, when they would move far away from here. But today, this tiny little person who held his mother's hand so tight made it more worthwhile. A mother, a father, a little girl – there was so much to look forward to, all for this little one who held on so tightly. In that hospital room, surrounded by the sights, smells, and sounds of life, Faisal knew that he was exactly where he was meant to be – not only to be with his new sister but also with a heart overflowing with emotions that echoed the depth of what family stood for, what love stood for and where this tiny being played its role so delicately and yet significantly. The realization flooded his heart and his eyes with tears, not knowing what tomorrow would hold or how this little bundle would change his life over time with its fragile needs and cries and needs and every step as his heart beat over this love for his new sister.\n\nIn the cold, crisp air, wrapped in warm blankets, the tiny figure was placed safely in Faisal's mother's arms, and his little sister yawned, releasing her tight grip to let out a weak little cough, reminding Faisal that as much as anything in life could be scary, it could also be beautiful. The road ahead was uncertain, but for now, Faisal found that by embracing the love of his newborn sister, he found his strength to face whatever came next.\n\nThe family of three, now including the newborn Faisal would know all her life – his sister, who held on so tight – wrapped themselves in so much hope and so much love and so much hope with every silent, every little cry for help in her fragile, fragile existence",
