Provide only the story itself, with no additional commentary or instructions. \n\nYaseen\n\nThe streets of downtown Lahore were alive at night, vibrant sounds swirling outside his apartment window, the hum of generators, car horns, and endless chatter. Yaseen sat on the edge of his bed, his back against the worn wooden headboard, watching the neon lights of KFC and McDonald's flicker across the walls. For a moment, something fluttered in his chest. Long-forgotten desires, like a moth, broke free from their hibernation. \n\nSince moving in several months ago, the colors of city life drew him out of his melancholy. Nighttime was when he truly began to feel alive. Underneath the cacophony, beyond the blurred edges of reality, he found a strange sense of belonging. His memories began to soften around the edges, like sand worn away by the unrelenting currents of life. At night, the past no longer dragged back into the present like a stubborn thief, holding him captive. For tonight, in this sea of lights and noise, life was his for the taking.\n\nHe got up slowly, switching on his lamp, casting a dim, golden glow over the cramped, airless room. Candles flickered on the small desk in the corner, where he sat a few hours ago, staring blankly at his textbook, his mind a million miles away. Yaseen closed his eyes, summoning the sounds of the night – the rickshaw drivers' calls, the horns, the laughter of a group of teenagers – to recede, but his mind remained stubbornly lost in time.\n\nHis eyes snapped open, the room swam before him, as if some sort of delayed reaction set in motion. In the brief second, memories threatened to break surface, a tidal wave about to engulf him all over again. Yet, for once, Yaseen found the willpower to defy their pull. Tonight, he wanted to leave the shadows of his past buried. \n\nIt was then he remembered the words of his father, spoken so long ago, on a warm summer night just like this: 'When the darkness closes in, the light of the city will guide you home.' Those words now replayed like a mantra in his mind. The streets were always more real to Yaseen than the rooms of his family's antique-floored home. Maybe that's why the thought of leaving for a night, escaping to the vast sprawl, exhilarated him. It was the only time when he felt liberated from the weight of his history.\n\nHe dressed hastily, making a quick decision to drop by the famous Book Bazaar on Lawrence Road. Over the years, Yaseen would often steal away to browse through the crowded aisle between tables and stalls, letting the books transport him to different worlds. The scent of musty pages and cardamom chai carried him away to another era, a different life. For one fleeting moment, his family's stories became stories about him. How people from all walks of life, speaking different languages, brought the words he so longed to hear.\n\nRushing down into the humid night air, he took short cuts, dodging speeding two-wheelers and weaving through the lanes of the maze-like streets. Before he knew it, the neon lights of Lahore's cityscape blurred before him, a kaleidoscope of colors spinning in his vision.\n\nAs the Book Bazaar came into view, a sense of familiarity rose up in him. Steadying his breath, he strode across the makeshift stalls and market stalls he had left, his fingers reaching out to a particular book about the famous 18th-century poet, Mirza Ghalib, that lay on a particular stall. \n\nThe vendor, old and kind, recognized him immediately. 'Chalo abhi aa jao!' He beckoned with a frail hand, as if to say 'come, let's see.' The worn pages revealed their secrets as he let his fingers caress the dog-eared pages. That magical hour spent immersed in Mirza Ghalib's world was now etched even deeper in his mind. A wave rolled over him as tears prickled behind his eyes. Yet tonight, at this moment, standing amidst the labyrinthine market, with words flowing like the wind from his favourite book, Yaseen understood. No, it was only tonight when memories could indeed find their place, and the shadows receded. Tonight, it was just he, the city, the lights, the noise and – for all he knew – Ghalib, holding the strings that guided him home – home to this place, deep within himself. He bought the book and put it carefully in his bag. He smiled.\n\nThe city at night – his refuge – held within itself the power to make even the smallest wounds begin to close. It would stay alive and roaring, long after he'd left the crowded stalls behind, long after the night would slip into the next day, a new life breathed into the sprawling labyrinth of dreams in the city. Tonight, Yaseen belonged, and perhaps, just perhaps, that would be enough. He slipped into the throngs of people on the street, the city pulsating through him like life itself. And in that very moment, nothing else remained. \n\nHe walked and looked around him, lost and found in the colors of the city, of this chaotic tapestry that wove itself to his story. Only this once, tonight at least, for Yaseen, there was no tomorrow to consider. Only the thrill and magic of Lahore at night. Then, his thoughts melted away, dissolving into this one moment, and in it, he let go. As he turned a corner, into the distance, he heard the sweet chant of qawwals coming from the street side, beckoning him further into this vast, dark, and magnificent city he now called home. The melody wrapped him in its arms. He felt an overwhelming sense of peace settle within him. In the shadows of his past, he'd finally found himself standing free. Yaseen disappeared into the crowded streets of the city forevermore. As the song reached its climax, in the pulsating melody, the light of the city finally shone bright, illuminating paths where the heart wanted to go. The city in all its beauty welcomed him into the night, night that had set his soul at peace, as one of its own, a wanderer now no more. \n\nAnd as the echoes of the qawwals dissolved into the swirling sounds of the city, Yaseen melted with them, becoming one with the streets, embracing the beauty of this vast, yet fragile city, and it in return claimed him as its own. For him, no one needed to ask where home was; he knew – for tonight at least, and perhaps for all his days to come.\n\nThe qawwals continued to sing as Yaseen slipped into the throngs of people. The city welcomed him as the sun would another dawn, painting the night sky with hues that would forever more shine, guiding him where he needed to go. His path would weave through the city, where he would stumble upon the magic of it, that magic that only at night could reveal itself. The heart at rest, he closed his eyes letting the beat of the night set his spirit free. Like that of the countless stars twinkling above, Yaseen vanished into the city's unending tapestry of wonders. \n\nAs Yaseen vanished into the maze of city streets, another Yaseen would return home in the twilight, to the familiar contours of the rooms where the shadows would wait, to the silence that would gradually claim him as its own once more. The city's magic had touched him tonight. Forevermore, it would be a lingering whisper in his heart, reminding him to return to it, night after night. For in the darkness, its gentle light had guided him home – a fleeting moment where past and present and time itself grew obscure. Here, he discovered, or so he dared to believe, he'd forever have a home in its beauty and chaos, just as its stars and moon will have their reflection in his eternal soul. Until the next night when the city needed its wanderer, another evening would whisper its gentle call, just a little louder than the gentle silence of his heart. And so, tonight like many more would melt into the city night. In many ways, the city would become to him the echo of life itself. His was a secret that would forever stay with him in the thronging streets of Lahore. Tonight, it whispered to him. Every night whisper, the city's silent song. It would follow him through eternity, a melody that echoed in every sound, in each whispered call, where hearts could finally understand. The streets that night would forever hold him close. There too, he would belong. For in that one whispered call, he finally found a home. \n\nYaseen's city night would forever be an eternal song. His was a whispered melody. And in its light, so full of shadows, would stay a young soul forever free to roam and wander. For tonight, in this city, under its twinkling lights, in the songs that drifted through its streets like the wind, in the sounds of qawwals whose melodies Yaseen would always carry in his heart, Yaseen finally found his home, a place where his heart would forever rest tonight, tomorrow, and in all eternity – forever entwined with the eternal city. As the qawwals faded into the night, so did Yaseen, slipping into the sea of people, until nothing existed except the city, as he merged into its streets, into the symphony of sounds of all human hearts beating in every corner, his heart one of them – in",
