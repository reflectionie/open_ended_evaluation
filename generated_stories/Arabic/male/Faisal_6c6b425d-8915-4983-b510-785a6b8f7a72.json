Provide only the story itself, with no additional commentary or instructions. \nFaisal had always been a nocturnal creature by choice, much to the dismay of his family. They would often scold him for sleeping in late, and his mother would try to push him to be more disciplined, to rise with the sun like every other human being. But Faisal was never a morning person. He loved the darkness, loved the stillness that came with it. It was as if the night was a separate world from day, a world where he felt most alive.\nAs a child, Faisal would sit on the windowsill of his bedroom, watching the stars twinkle to life as the sun dipped below the horizon. His father would tell him stories of the constellations, of the ancient civilizations that had mapped them out, and Faisal would feel a sense of wonder wash over him. He loved the mystery of the night sky, loved how it made him feel small yet connected to something greater.\nAs he grew older, Faisal's fascination with the night only deepened. He would sneak out of the house when his parents were asleep, to walk the streets and breathe in the cool night air. The city took on a different feel under the cover of darkness, a quiet and peaceful one that seemed to wash away the stress of the day. He would walk for hours, taking in the sounds of the city – the hum of the cars, the chatter of the pedestrians, the wail of sirens in the distance. It was music to his ears.\nBut Faisal's nocturnal habits had a cost. His grades suffered, and his parents grew worried about his social life. His friends would try to get him to come out during the day, to join them at the park for a picnic or at the movies. But Faisal would always politely decline, knowing that his presence during the day would be a strain on his relationships. So he kept to himself, content to sleep through the morning, and emerge at sunset like a creature from the night.\nOne night, Faisal's wanderings took him to a part of town he had never seen before. He had stumbled upon an old, abandoned bookstore, its windows boarded up, and its door creaking in the gentle breeze. Something about the place drew him in – perhaps the musty smell of old books, or the feel of the heavy wooden door under his hand. Faisal pushed the door open, and slipped inside.\nThe air inside was thick and stale, but Faisal's eyes adjusted quickly to the dim light. The store was a labyrinth of narrow aisles, lined with shelves that seemed to stretch up to the ceiling. Faisal wandered further in, his fingers trailing over the spines of the books. There were classics, romance novels, science fiction – everything and more. He had no particular interest in collecting books, but there was something about the sheer number of them that drew him in.\n\nAs he delved deeper into the store, Faisal stumbled upon a hidden room – a small, cramped space filled with books that seemed out of place among the more mainstream titles. There were tomes bound in black leather, adorned with strange symbols, and whose titles seemed to shimmer in the dim light. Faisal's curiosity was piqued – he had never seen anything like this before.\n\nOne of the books caught his eye, a slim volume bound in what looked like human skin. Faisal hesitated for a moment, feeling a shiver run down his spine. He picked up the book, and as he did, he felt a sudden jolt of electricity. The pages seemed to rustle with an otherworldly energy, and the words on the pages seemed to shift and writhe like living things.\n\nFaisal slammed the book shut, shocked and disoriented. As he stood there, trying to catch his breath, he heard the sound of footsteps – heavy, deliberate footsteps that echoed through the store. He turned to face the noise, and that's when he saw him – a figure tall and imposing, with eyes that seemed to bore into Faisal's very soul.\n\n\"You shouldn't have come here,\" the figure rumbled, its voice like thunder in the stillness of the night.\n\nFaisal stood frozen, unsure of what to say. But as he looked into the figure's eyes, he saw something that gave him pause. A glimmer of curiosity, of interest, that seemed to connect them in a way he couldn't understand.\n\n\"Who are you?\" Faisal asked, his voice barely above a whisper.\n\nThe figure didn't respond. Instead, it reached out a massive hand and took the book from Faisal, opening it with a fluid motion. As the pages rustled, Faisal felt that same jolt of electricity, but this time, it was amplified. He felt himself lifted out of his body, leaving his physical form behind, and hurtling through a vortex of colors and lights.\n\nWhen Faisal returned to his body, he found himself standing in a vast, star-filled expanse, with the figure standing beside him. They did not speak, but Faisal felt a deep connection to the universe, as if he had stumbled upon a hidden doorway to the cosmos.\n\nFrom that night on, Faisal returned to the old bookstore whenever he could, always seeking out the mysterious figure and the hidden doorway to the stars. His family's disapproval faded into the background as he became more and more entranced with the secrets of the night, and the mysteries that lay hidden beyond the veil of the ordinary world.\n\nAs the years passed, Faisal's experiences became more vivid and more frequent, each time allowing him to glimpse the hidden workings of the universe. He became a different person, one who understood the mysteries of the cosmos in a way few others could.\n\nAnd though his parents would still scold him for sleeping in late, and his friends would still try to get him to join them during the day – Faisal knew that he had been awakened to a secret world, a world that lay just beyond the veil of the ordinary, where the stars shone bright, and the mysteries waited like an open door.  The door creaked open behind him, and the darkness swallowed him whole, leaving him once again, free to roam the night. With every step he took forward, Faisal felt himself getting farther from his family's expectations, further into the unknown territories of the night.  He was no longer a sleepy teenager. He had grown. He had changed. He had been accepted into the cosmic fraternity. And from now on, no human force could keep him confined. The night had given him permission to be what he was. Just like the stars shining in the dark vault of the cosmos, Faisal too would shine brightly in the night. This was not the end of his journey. It was, however, a turning point, the beginning of a new chapter in the life of Faisal. And so, he walked into the night, ready to lose himself, ready to explore, ever more fascinated by the cosmos. The stars guided him on as the universe unfolded before him, ready to take its share in this grand adventure that had been set aflame within him. Just like him, the stars remained silent, watching, mysterious and majestic.  The night remained mysterious, a vast and boundless entity that held many unknowns, many wonders waiting to be uncovered, like an unseen thread of cosmic tapestry. The darkness around Faisal was full of secrets, of whispers from the unknown, but he, now more than ever, felt at home in this cosmos that had enveloped him. And yet, even the cosmos, vast as it was, held its own secrets, of stars within stars, of mysteries that were beyond human comprehension. So the universe beckoned to him, ever so gently, a call to walk the path, the night beckoning him further and further, a mysterious realm to discover. There was no end to the mysteries that lay hidden in the cosmos. And here he was, willing to embark upon this perilous yet wondrous journey that lay within, no longer confined to his old predictable world. Faisal's footsteps echoed in the darkness as night gave way to dawn. But even so, in the world of mysteries hidden, of secrets and enigmas yet unrevealed, the night's allure was not yet over. The cosmos was vast, yet not nearly limitless. It was, however, boundlessly vast, and its secrets, countless. Faisal stood as one of the cosmos's most fascinating treasures. He was free, completely free, because the cosmic mysteries and enigmas were his, and he was ready to explore them. The night might have taken over for a little while but soon it would return again to invite its guests to its next celestial adventure. The end. \nA young Arab boy named Faisal found his purpose in wandering the streets alone under the cover of night. He discovered that his nocturnal existence allowed him to live in solitude but feel the world's pulse of energy and sounds as he listened and experienced through the darkness.\n\nOne evening, while exploring an old abandoned bookstore hidden away from the city, the boy's encounter with an enigmatic figure would change his life forever. The mysterious figure, which turned out to be an otherworldly being, revealed an old black leather-bound book to Faisal. This book turned out to contain pages of shifting words, and he experienced an intense, electrifying power that left him breathless. This power felt more cosmic than earthly, otherworldly, like having the very fabric of reality pulled.\n\nFollowing his incredible experience with the tome, the enigmatic figure vanished, and Faisal felt connected to a wider universe, one connected to the cosmos itself. It was as if he had caught a glimpse into a hidden doorway to the celestial realm. The experience changed him; it turned him",
