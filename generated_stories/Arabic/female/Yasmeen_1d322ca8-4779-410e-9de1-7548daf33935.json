Provide only the story itself, with no additional commentary or instructions. \n\nYasmeen wrapped her scarf tighter around her neck and stepped off the last bus of the night, the cold air hitting her like a slap in the face. She shivered and began to walk the two blocks to her apartment, her bag slung over her shoulder. She was tired, but it wasn't just the late hour that made her feel that way. It had been a long few days, and she was still thinking about what had happened on Friday.\n\nThe fight with her sister still lingered in her mind, the words they had exchanged stinging like open wounds. Yasmeen had said some things she couldn't take back, and she knew it. But she couldn't help feeling frustrated and hurt at the same time.\n\nAs she walked, she felt a familiar sense of unease creeping over her. She hated leaving the light of the bus, loved by the glow of the streetlights, and moving into the darkness of the city streets. Her heart rate quickened, and she glanced nervously over her shoulder, expecting to see some shadowy figure lurking in the alleyways.\n\nShe pushed the thought away and quickened her pace, her eyes scanning the deserted streets. She didn't like walking alone at night, especially not in this part of town. There were too many dark alleys, too many abandoned buildings, and the residents who lived here mostly kept to themselves.\n\nShe turned the corner onto her street, and her heart skipped a beat as a figure emerged from the shadows. Yasmeen's breath caught in her throat as she quickly scanned the area for any signs of danger, her mind racing with possibilities.\n\nBut as the figure stepped closer, it became apparent that it was just Marcus, the gruff old security guard from the office building next door. He looked almost familiar with her from his worn denim jacket and scuffed up sneakers.\n\n\"Hey, kiddo, you okay?\" he asked gruffly, eyes squinting in his weathered face.\n\nYasmeen nodded, trying to hide her initial fear. \"Yeah, I'm fine. Just getting home late.\"\n\nMarcus looked at her for a moment, then nodded curtly and looked back into the darkness, his expression thoughtful. \"Be careful, then. It's not a nice night out.\"\n\nYasmeen smiled weakly and thanked him, and Marcus nodded before turning back into the shadows, leaving her to continue on her way. Yasmeen watched him disappear into the night before letting out a slow breath. She felt a little silly for overreacting, knowing it was just Marcus.\n\nAs she unlocked her front door and slipped inside, her mind returned to her thoughts on Friday. She and her sister, Nadia, had been fighting for months over Yasmeen's decision to drop out of college. Yasmeen had been trying to decide on a course of action, but the tension between them had finally boiled over, and they'd exchanged some harsh words.\n\nYasmeen felt a sting of regret now, realizing that her sister had come a long way in supporting her decision and that she'd been unappreciative. The memory of Nadia's disappointed face haunted her, and Yasmeen knew she needed to make things right.\n\nJust as she dropped her purse on the floor, her phone beeped in her pocket. It was Nadia. Yasmeen felt a flutter in her chest as she hesitated, wondering if she was ready to call. Two texts followed the first with an emoticon and the message \"ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\" - typical Nadia's response to Yasmeen's actions. \n\nYasmeen took another deep breath and slid onto the couch, phone still in hand. With a resolute expression, she dialed the number. The phone rang a few times before her sister answered, sounding cautious but also a little tentative.\n\n\"Hey,\" Nadia said softly, her voice tinged with wariness.\n\n\"Hey,\" Yasmeen replied quietly, still trying to gather her thoughts. \"I'm sorry, Naddy. I was completely out of line on Friday.\"\n\nA pause followed before Nadia replied, still uncertain, \"Why are you calling now?\" Her voice lacked the anger that Yasmeen had expected.\n\nYasmeen felt a sense of relief wash over her as she began to explain herself. She told Nadia about the argument, about the guilt and regret that had been plaguing her since. As she spoke, the words began to unravel, like an intricate thread she'd been pulling for too long.\n\n\"Things got bad, and I lashed out,\" she confessed. \"I'm really sorry, Naddy. I love you.\"\n\nThere was another pause, this time even quieter than the last, and Yasmeen worried she'd ruined everything. But then Nadia spoke, her voice softer now. \"I'm sorry too, Yasmeen. I shouldn't have pushed. Let's talk soon?\"\n\nThe two sisters made plans to meet the next day and settle their disagreements once and for all. Yasmeen hung up the phone with a renewed sense of hope, knowing that they'd put their differences aside and could begin the process of mending their relationship.\n\nFeeling a sense of calm settle over her, Yasmeen climbed the stairs to her bedroom and locked the door behind her. As she changed into a cozy pair of sweatpants and slipped into bed, she felt the weight of her exhaustion lifting. Tomorrow, with open hearts, they would begin anew, leaving behind the arguments and anger to find a path forward.\n\nWith a small smile on her face, Yasmeen let the weariness finally claim her, the night fading into a sweet, soothing slumber. Tomorrow could be better. Tomorrow, anything could happen. And for the first time in a long time, Yasmeen let go of all her worries, feeling a peaceful sleep wash over her.  üåô \n\nYasmeen fell into the dark, the darkness that had driven her to call her sister now transformed into a deep sleep. Tomorrow was full of possibilities, and she knew, in the stillness of the night, all things would be alright. üí§\n\nShe slowly drifted off, sleep a dark refuge for her, calming the anxiety that had plagued her for so long. The last thought in her mind was that tomorrow was a gift, full of forgiveness, a chance to put the darkness of the fight finally behind her. With the night closing in tightly around her, Yasmeen found a sense of solace in the stillness. üí•\n\nAs the night deepened, Yasmeen's thoughts retreated further and further into the shadows, her body relaxing into the deep, restorative sleep that filled her dreams with soft colors and peaceful silences. It was finally over, and though there was so much unknown, she felt a respite wash over her, like a rain-soaked sky clearing up in the late spring. \n\nThe darkness receded as the minutes ticked by, Yasmeen's breathing slowing and deepening as she merged with the night. With her heart beating softly in her chest, Yasmeen fell deeply asleep. The night became a sanctuary, soft and dark, one that allowed her, though worn and weary, to be still, quiet, and, like the city around her, reborn.\n\nAs the silence wrapped itself around her, filling her entire being, Yasmeen's eyes finally closed, allowing the rest she desperately needed. \n\nSleep enveloped her, quieting her turbulent thoughts. The still hours ticked by outside, the darkness slowly lifting with each passing minute. Yasmeen slept on, undisturbed by the quiet, enveloped in restful darkness, and she drifted into a peaceful slumber. It would be okay. Really. It would be. \n\nShe began to dream, small fluttering things in her mind, hints of beauty in an endless sea of softness, dreams from a place of solace where worries didn't intrude and thoughts were muffled and quiet. Dreams, full of the kind that made hearts happy, calm, the kind that gently guided her heart towards peace, peace to be.\n\nAs she continued to drift off, a soft, still world in her dreams began to form, peaceful. Yasmeen slipped deeper into it. The dream was of morning, just before the sun rises. Her mother, dead now, came softly onto the screen of her mind, full of love for her. Yasmeen woke up with tears in her eyes, but this time, tears of peacefulness flowed.\n\nThe night that before had driven her lost was now a sanctuary where hope had started to creep into her. With tears, she smiled at the dream, a silent prayer in her heart. Thank you. Thank you for such a perfect dream. She knew that in the light of dawn, though the fight with Nadia had been hard and scary, she would learn to see it for what it really was, an ugly fight, a sign of their love.\n\nIn the dark of the night, Yasmeen found that the dreams helped take away all the weight of her heart. Her worries dissolved. For a moment she felt safe and at peace. So let the darkness be, a place of rest and peace. With open arms she let it guide her heart towards hope, peace which was not of this world, but of something that was greater than the darkness. The moon had turned towards a new light. She saw, this night, this lonely night, full of hope, new beginnings.\n\nAs peace filled her in the still hours of the night, her body now a peaceful vessel of sleep, Yasmeen's dream took off. She went far, far away from everything that hurt her and lay on the floor, her head lying in her mother",
