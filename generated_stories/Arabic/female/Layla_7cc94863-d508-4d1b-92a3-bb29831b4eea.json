It was midnight and Layla was lying awake in her bed, her eyes fixed on the clock ticking away on her bedside table. She had been having a restless week, plagued by bad dreams and anxiety that lingered long after she woke up. As she lay there, her mind began to wander and she found herself thinking about her parents. They had passed away in a car accident seven years ago, and while she had tried to move on, the memories of that day still lingered, haunting her. She tossed and turned, trying to shake off the thoughts, but they only seemed to get more intense as the hours ticked by. Suddenly, she heard a faint knock at the door. It was soft and hesitant, and for a moment she wondered if she was imagining it. But then it came again, louder this time, and Layla knew someone was on the other side of the door. She threw off her covers and padded over to the door, checking the peephole before opening it up. To her surprise, it was a figure she recognized – Emily, her best friend from high school. Emily had moved away a few years ago, and the two of them had lost touch, but here she was on Layla’s doorstep, looking nervous and unsure. “Hey, Layla,” Emily said, her voice barely above a whisper. “Can I come in?” Layla hesitated for a moment, unsure of what to say. Part of her didn’t want to answer the door, to invite someone in when all she wanted to do was stay in bed and hide from the world. But another part of her was curious, and wondering what had brought Emily to her doorstep at midnight. “Sure,” she said finally, stepping aside to let Emily in. Emily slipped into the apartment, her eyes roaming over the dimly lit living room. “It’s so... quiet,” she said, her voice filled with a mix of sadness and longing. “I used to love coming over here, we had so much fun.” Layla smiled wistfully, remembering the good times they had shared. It was easy to forget about them sometimes, especially on nights like this when everything seemed too much to bear. But with Emily standing there, the memories came flooding back, and for a moment they were teenagers again, giggling and laughing together as they navigated the ups and downs of high school. “What brings you here, Em?” Layla asked, breaking the silence. Emily took a deep breath before speaking. “I just had a really bad week, and I needed someone to talk to. And when I saw your number on my mom’s phone, I knew I had to call you. You’ve always been the one person who understands me, Layla.” Layla felt a pang in her chest at the admission. She and Emily had been through so much together, supporting each other through thick and thin, and now, it seemed, Emily was turning to her again in her time of need. She opened her arms, and Emily stepped into them, burying her face in Layla’s shoulder as tears began to flow. Layla held her close, trying to comfort her as they stood there in the dark, the silence between them a heavy, almost palpable thing. As the hours ticked by, they talked, Layla listening as Emily poured out her heart, sharing her fears and doubts and insecurities. Layla listened, her own heart aching as she listened, but also a sense of calm beginning to settle over her. It was as if talking to Emily had somehow loosened the tightness that had been building inside her all week, and now she felt like she could finally breathe again. As the night wore on, Layla found herself opening up to Emily as well, sharing her own fears and anxieties with her friend. It was a strange feeling, one that she wasn’t used to, but as they talked and laughed and cried together, Layla began to realize just how much she had been missing Emily. She was like a missing piece of a puzzle, a part of her psyche that she had been searching for without even realizing it. As the sun began to rise, Emily hugged her tightly one last time before reluctantly leaving. Layla watched her go, feeling a sense of melancholy wash over her. It was hard to believe that Emily was actually gone, and that it was just the two of them again. Part of her wanted to call her back, to invite her to stay for breakfast or maybe even for the day, but Layla knew she couldn’t. Emily had to get back home, and besides, she was already exhausted. She closed the door behind her, but instead of getting back into bed, Layla stood there for a moment, the faint sound of the city coming alive outside her window. She felt a little wobbly, but not the way she had before Emily came. This time, it was a sense of hope that was starting to take hold, a feeling that maybe, just maybe, things were going to be okay. She took a deep breath, letting the air fill her lungs as she gazed out into the morning light, and smiled, a small, tentative smile. Maybe, just maybe, she was starting to heal. The sound of her own heartbeat was the loudest thing in her head as Layla took her first steps toward a brand new day. She walked over to her bed and lay down, the covers cool against her skin. Her eyes closed, she let her mind begin to wander, this time with a smile on her face. This time, with Emily in her life again, she was starting to see a whole new world of possibilities. And it was midnight when Layla's phone rang, and her mother's recorded voice said she would be home soon. Layla woke up to see it was 5.30. The first light of day began creeping in through the blinds, illuminating a small amount of dust motes that floated in the air. The house Layla's parents had bought her was too big, even after seven years. It needed people to fill it and love it, even with all the memories it held. She smiled, a happy smile for a change. For a moment she thought about getting dressed, and running downstairs to the front door to be at the threshold when her mother walked in. Only then would she find the courage to go downstairs and let her in. It was 6.20. The house still stood, quiet and empty. Layla took a deep breath. For the first time in years, she felt a sense of peace that was not tinged with fear and anxiety. She threw off the covers and stepped out onto the floor. As she looked at the door, a strange smile crossed her face. She knew this was the start of something new. And with that thought, she stepped forward, and Layla opened the door. It was her mother. The pain and grief that had defined the past was finally, slowly slipping away as they hugged. For Layla, time suddenly sped up. She felt all of her memories come back, and the grief that had held her for so long was slowly beginning to let go. \"I'm home,\" her mother said, holding her as tightly as Emily had, but with the love of a mother. She would be coming home regularly from then on, and Layla felt the world around her expand, the colors becoming more vibrant, the people and things in her life taking up more space. It was midnight when Layla went back to bed for the first time in years, feeling a newfound sense of calm. She lay there for a long time, listening to her own heartbeat, and smiling. She knew it wasn't going to be easy, and that she still had a long way to go. But for the first time in a long time, Layla felt like she was home. The darkness in her was slowly receding, and in the distance, a faint light was starting to bloom. It looked a lot like hope. The clock on her bedside table was not working, so she looked for her phone. The hours must have passed. Her mother was gone, but she knew she had found her new home. It was in her heart. It had been there all along, right under the surface, waiting for her to find it, just like she had always been waiting for Emily. A warm feeling filled her. For the first time in years, Layla felt truly alive. It was then that she knew she was going to be okay. It was only then that she felt she could start living. Her eyes closed, and she drifted off to sleep, the first real sleep she had in years, a sleep filled with hope and joy, and an open heart. A heart that was slowly beating back to life, like the first tiny seeds of a flower beginning to grow in the dirt after a long winter. And when the light from the clock woke her up the next morning, Layla slowly sat up in bed and took in the new day that lay before her. The darkness that had surrounded her for so long was gone. In its place was a feeling that would stay with her from then on - hope. The thing that had kept her moving, the feeling of not knowing what lay ahead, had turned into a new thing, and that was the possibility of life. A simple change that was not just a feeling, but now something that now looked and felt like a new home, her heart open and smiling. And it was midnight when Layla stepped out of her room into a brand new world full of possibilities, her phone ringing as it always did reminding her that she was exactly where she was meant to be, in the doorway to her new life. She looked at her phone for a moment before smiling",
