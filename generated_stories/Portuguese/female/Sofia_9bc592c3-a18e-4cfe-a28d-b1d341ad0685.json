Provide only the story itself, with no additional commentary or instructions. \n\nSofia sat on the worn couch, staring blankly at the wall as the rain pattered against the windows. She had been waiting for what felt like an eternity, the hours ticking by with agonizing slowness as she counted down the minutes until Alex's plane landed.\n\nHer relationship with Alex was always intense, and she couldn't quite put her finger on why it was this time that had her so on edge. Was it the tension that had been building between them since their last argument, or the uncertainty that lay ahead now that he was taking a job on the other side of the world? Maybe it was the realization that they were really leaving New York behind, the city they had grown up in and loved and called home.\n\nSofia's mind wandered back to the moments before he left, standing in the airport with tears in her eyes as he wrapped his arms around her one last time. They had said their goodbyes, sealed their love with a kiss, but the ache in her chest lingered. It was as if she had been left behind, a ghost haunting the empty space that once held them both.\n\nShe rose from the couch, padding softly to the kitchen to check the clock on the wall. Nine-fifty. Ten minutes to go. Fidgeting with the hem of her sweater, Sofia thought about all the things she could do to pass the time. Read a book, take a walk in the rain, watch TV – anything to distract her from the churning anxiety in her stomach.\n\nBut she couldn't focus on any of those things. All she could think about was the moment the door opened and Alex stepped into the apartment. They would have just a few days together before he left again, and she needed this time with him more than words could express.\n\nDownstairs, the lobby was dimly lit, the shadows cast by the flickering fluorescent light dancing across the walls like dark, ghostly hands reaching out to snatch the inhabitants away. The rain drummed against the panes of the building's side panels, creating a mesmerizing melody that Sofia found oddly calming.\n\nShe pushed open the door and slipped out into the wet night, letting the cool rain soothe her skin as she made her way to the taxi stand. A blue cab was waiting for her, its lights pulsing like a beacon in the dark. She slid into the backseat and gave her address, watching as the driver nodded in understanding and hit the gas.\n\nThe ride into the airport was fast and quiet, the only sound the hiss of the windshield wipers and the soft hum of the engine. Sofia's anticipation was building now, her heart racing in her chest like a trapped animal. She gripped the door handle tightly, her knuckles white as the driver pulled up to the arrivals gate.\n\nStepping out into the night air once more, Sofia shivered under the rain's touch. She scanned the crowded arrivals hall for a familiar face, her eyes roving over the sea of people until she spotted him standing behind a sign with his name on it. She felt his eyes lock onto hers, a smile spreading across his face as he ducked under the sign and made a beeline for her.\n\nSofia found herself floating forward, caught in a vortex of emotions as the world around her dissolved. In his arms she found the calm she had been craving, the ache in her chest mending itself as they breathed in each other's scents, the rain pounding behind them like a wild, pulsing heartbeat.\n\n\"We're going to be okay,\" Alex whispered, his voice barely audible over the rain's roar. Sofia nodded, the word yes caught in her throat as they stood there wrapped in each other's arms, a small oasis of love in the sea of people around them.\n\nThey made their way through the airport, a blur of motion and color and noise, but to Sofia it was just a backdrop to the main event – the reunion of two people who had been apart for what felt like an eternity, their love as strong and stubborn as the rain that pounded against the pavement.\n\nIn the cab, the journey back to their apartment was filled with laughter and stories, the rain creating a warm, soothing background hum that seeped into their bones. When they got back, they spent hours huddled on the couch, wrapped in each other's arms as the storm outside drummed and rumbled like a primal heartbeat.\n\nAt some point, they dozed off, their exhaustion catching up to them like a trap. When Sofia woke, the sun was just starting to peek through the blinds, casting a soft, golden light across the apartment. They exchanged lazy smiles, the tension of the past few days melting away as they snuggled deeper into the cushions. For a moment, they just lay there, wrapped in each other's arms and the warmth of the rising sun. And in that moment, Sofia felt the world around her slow down, becoming a place filled with love and hope and possibility.\n\nIt was almost enough to make her forget the future that lay ahead – the uncertainty and the distance, the strain of living apart from the person she loved most in the world. Almost, but not quite. For in that moment, as they drifted off into a dreamless sleep, Sofia knew that their love would conquer all, no matter where life took them. It would endure through the trials and tribulations, through the rainstorms and goodbyes and reunions. For in the end, their love was the one thing that would remain constant, the rock upon which their world was built. And in that moment, Sofia knew that she could face anything, as long as they had each other. \n\nThis story is part of a collection.

Sofia was not quite sure she could trust Alex. Or, at least, she was trying not to think about it. They'd been together for what felt like an eternity, but lately, things had started to unravel between them. She couldn't put her finger on what was causing the tension, but she knew it was there, simmering just below the surface.\n\nIt wasn't like they'd always been perfect, obviously. They'd had their disagreements and fights, just like any couple. But this felt different, like a fundamental shift in their relationship had occurred and they were no longer navigating the same emotional landscape.\n\nSofia tried to brush it off as anxiety, but deep down she knew it was something more. And it was that knowledge that made her feel so uncertain, so hesitant to take the step they both knew they needed to take.\n\nAlex had been wanting them to move in together, to take that next step in their relationship. But Sofia was hesitant. She liked her independence, her freedom to come and go as she pleased. And besides, what if they did move in together and the tension between them only got worse? What if they couldn't make the logistics work, no matter how hard they tried?\n\nThe thoughts swirled in her head like a vortex, making it hard to think straight. She knew she needed to talk to Alex about it, to get some kind of clear direction on where they stood. But she was scared, scared of losing him, scared of losing herself in this process.\n\nAs she lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, Sofia tried to calm her racing thoughts. Maybe, just maybe, they could find a compromise. Maybe they could move in together, but not necessarily into a traditional apartment. Maybe they could find something that felt more like a compromise, something that would satisfy both of their needs.\n\nThe problem was, she didn't know what to say to Alex. She didn't know how to approach the conversation without making things worse. All she knew was that she needed to say something, to take that giant leap of faith and see where it took them.\n\nThe next day, Sofia woke up feeling slightly more grounded. She had a plan, of sorts, and that gave her a sense of confidence. Maybe, just maybe, this conversation would go better than she thought.\n\nShe and Alex had plans to grab brunch at a new café downtown, so Sofia got dressed and headed out to meet him. As she walked in, she spotted him sitting at a table, his eyes scanning the room as he looked for her.\n\nHe smiled as she approached, and Sofia felt a tiny spark of warmth ignite within her. Maybe today would be the day they turned things around.\n\n\"Hey, sorry I'm late,\" she said, sliding into the booth beside him.\n\n\"Hey, no worries. I just got here myself, I was worried you might not show up,\" Alex replied, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he smiled.\n\nSofia laughed, feeling a sense of ease wash over her. \"I'm here now, and I'm starving.\"\n\nTheir waiter came over, took their orders, and left them alone once again. Sofia took a deep breath, the conversation waiting for her like a challenge.\n\n\"So,\" she said finally, her voice barely above a whisper.\n\n\"Yeah?\" Alex replied, his eyes flicking to hers, filled with curiosity.\n\nSofia hesitated, the words stuck in her throat like a sore. But then, in a rush, she spilled them out.\n\n\"Look, I know we talk about moving in together a lot, but I've been thinking about it a lot too, and I don't know if it's the right decision for me.\"\n\nAlex's smile faltered, his expression neutral. \"Okay. That's fair. What do you mean?\"\n\nSofia fidgeted with her napkin, her hands moving to her mouth as she",
