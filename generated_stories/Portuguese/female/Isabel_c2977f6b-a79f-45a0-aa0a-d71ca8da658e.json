Isabel lay facedown on the old wooden dock that stretched out into the lake. The only sound she could hear was the quiet lapping of the water against the planks beneath her body. She closed her eyes and breathed deep, feeling the cool mist fill her lungs. It was early morning, the sun just starting to peek over the horizon. Isabel could see the faint outlines of trees swaying in the breeze beyond the lake's edge. In the distance, the sound of birds could be heard, their morning chirping filling the air. For a moment, she felt a sense of peace, as if the world had finally stopped spinning and all was right with the world. But it had only been a day since her sister's funeral. A day since her family had gathered to mourn their loss, since they'd all hugged and whispered their farewells to a girl who was supposed to be happy, carefree. A day since Isabel had stood in the church and watched as their mother wept uncontrollably, her body shaking with a grief that seemed to shake the very foundations of the world. What had it all been for? A single, terrible, beautiful moment. It was all a flash of life, but the pain that lingered afterward could consume her for years to come. Isabel had always felt safe with her sister. Lily had been the adventurous one, always pushing boundaries and exploring new horizons. Isabel, on the other hand, had been content to stick to the familiar paths, to take things slow and easy. But their bond was what mattered most. And now that bond was broken. Isabel felt a sob rising up in her chest. She tried to hold it back, afraid of letting go completely, but it burst forth from her lips. She wept into the dock, her body heaving as grief ripped through her. The sun continued to rise, warming the wooden planks beneath her, and Isabel felt its warmth spreading through her body, as if her skin were slowly thawing from a deep freeze. Her tears slowed to a trickle as she slowly raised her head. She looked out across the lake, taking in the beauty of the world around her. She felt a sense of longing rise up within her. She wanted it all back. She wanted to see her sister smile, to hear her laugh, to simply be with her again. Isabel scrambled to her feet, wiping away the remaining tears with the back of her hand. She took a few tentative steps towards the shore, feeling the dew-covered grass squelching beneath her feet. She made her way back to the little cabin that had been her family's summer home for as long as anyone could remember. The cabin stood quietly, its wooden walls still and steadfast, waiting patiently for the sounds of summer that would soon fill its rooms. Isabel stopped in the front doorway, hesitation washing over her. Should she go in and face their mother, or try to escape the pain for a little while longer? But as she stood there, she knew she couldn't keep running. Not anymore. It was time to face the pain head-on, to let it consume her if that's what it came to. She took a deep breath and pushed open the creaky screen door, stepping into the warm, golden light within. Inside, the cabin was quiet, the air thick with the scent of coffee and woodsmoke. The kitchen table had been cleared of dishes from the night before, leaving only a small notebook and a single pen lying across its surface. Isabel's heart skipped a beat as she spotted a note scribbled across the page. Go outside, it read. Watch the sunrise with me. She smiled briefly, tears rising to the surface once more. It was a note her sister might write. Isabel took a seat at the table, flipping through the pages of the notebook. Lily's handwriting was scattered throughout the book, little sketches and poems and lists of places she wanted to visit. Isabel's eyes lingered on a crude drawing of the two of them, a silly doodle of their family cat sprawled between them. She could almost hear Lily's laughter as she flipped through the pages, and her grief momentarily receded. For the first time since the funeral, Isabel felt a glimmer of hope. Maybe, just maybe, she could find a way to honor her sister's memory, to keep her love and her spirit alive, rather than simply losing her to the darkness. As the sun continued to rise outside, Isabel felt the warm light pouring through the windows, illuminating the cabin and its secrets. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, feeling the warmth spread through her body once more. This time, it was not solely a physical sensation. This time, it was a sense of peace, of acceptance. Isabel knew that the road ahead would be long and difficult, but with all her heart – and with her sister's memory – she felt ready to face whatever came next. The darkness had been terrifying, but by some strange, cruel twist of fate, it had also been a spark. It had ignited something deep within her, a spark of determination, of resilience, and of hope. And it was there, burning bright in her heart, that Isabel would let Lily's spirit live on. She opened her eyes, the notebook still clutched in her hand. She stood up, her gaze drifting out the window to the lake, to the trees that had stood tall and proud, to the sun's radiant light. For the first time in as long as she could remember, Isabel felt a sense of peace, a sense that Lily would be there to guide her through the darkness. She took a step forward, leaving the cabin, leaving the past, and leaving the grief behind. And when she looked up at the sky, a faint smile played across her lips. It was a new day. And it was going to be okay. Even if Lily was gone, she had left behind the one thing she'd ever truly loved – the light of her spirit, shining brightly within her heart. Isabel felt the warmth spread through her body, and for the first time in days, she felt the weight lifting, the grief slowly starting to recede. She stood on the threshold, her hand on the door frame, and smiled. Not for herself, but for her sister. Not because she wanted to be strong, but because she knew Lily would want that for her, even more than she wanted to be remembered. And in that moment, as the first light of dawn crept over the horizon, Isabel knew that she would be okay. She took one final look at the notebook on the kitchen table, its pages filled with her sister's laughter and beauty. With a quiet determination in her heart, she walked out into the dawn, ready to face the future, one smile at a time. The sky was brightening now, a warm golden light creeping over the hills and trees. Isabel stood still, feeling the weight of her grief slowly release its hold. Her sister was gone, but in that moment, she knew she would remember her. She would honor her memory, and she would learn to love – not just the good times, but the hard ones too. And with a newfound sense of peace in her heart, Isabel smiled, the wind rustling her hair as she stood on the lake's edge, feeling the world start anew. When the tears stopped, and she felt her breath slow, and her heart begin to steady, Isabel made her way back down to the dock. She sat down on the splintered planks, closing her eyes and letting the memory of her sister wash over her once more. This time, though, it wasn't tears that flowed through her. It was tears of joy, of laughter, of memories they'd created together over the years. Isabel smiled softly, her heart full, her soul quiet. She knew she'd carry her sister's memory with her for the rest of her life. But more than that, she'd never forget the light her spirit brought to the world – and the love, and the laughter, and the smiles that had been a part of their bond. And as she sat there, facing the water and watching the sun rise ever higher into the sky, Isabel felt the beginning of a new chapter unfolding in her life, her heart a little more open, a little more full of hope and promise. Slowly, slowly, she opened her eyes, smiling softly as she gazed out across the water. It was new territory, unknown and uncertain, but it was her territory now, too. And as she climbed to her feet, and stepped off the dock, and began walking across the lawn, feeling the dew-stained grass beneath her feet, Isabel knew that her sister was no longer by her side, but was inside her, shining a light of love, of memory, and of the laughter they'd shared. With her heart full of the memories of her sister, and of the joy they'd brought to her, Isabel stepped into the unknown, a small but fierce smile fixed on her lips, as she faced the rising sun. The sky was full of promise, full of light and beauty, and Isabel knew she'd take it with her, one step at a time, always knowing she'd always carry Lily's spark within her, a reminder that she'd lived, loved, and laughed, and that her sister's love would shine on inside her, always. With her eyes fixed on the horizon, her heart full of her sister's love, and her soul quiet at last, Isabel stepped into the new day, ready to walk forward, always knowing that a light of love and memory would guide her through the darkness. As she walked off into the distance, the first rays of the sun warming her skin, Isabel smiled softly to herself, the wind carrying the memories",
