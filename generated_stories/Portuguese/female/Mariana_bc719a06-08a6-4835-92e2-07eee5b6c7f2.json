Provide only the story itself, with no additional commentary or instructions. \n\nMariana woke up to the sound of waves crashing against the shore. She rubbed the sleep from her eyes, sitting up in bed and looking out the window at the vast expanse of ocean stretching before her. She'd always been drawn to the water, and after her father's death, her mother had decided to pack up the family and move to the beachside town where they'd lived for a few summers when Mariana was a child.\n\nIt had been six months since they'd moved, and Mariana still wasn't used to the isolation. The town was small enough that everyone knew each other, and gossip spread quickly. People would stare and whisper whenever she walked through the streets, assuming she was a rich girl from the city because of the clothes her mother bought her and the way they spoke. But Mariana knew the truth. They had struggled since her father's passing, and those designer clothes were a desperate attempt to hold onto what they'd once had.\n\nShe threw off the covers and made her way to the kitchen, where her mother was already brewing coffee. Mariana poured herself a glass of water and stood at the counter, sipping it and watching her mother through the steam.\n\n\"How are you doing today?\" she asked, trying to sound casual.\n\nHer mother looked up, surprised by the direct question. \"Okay, I guess. Just a little overwhelmed. Everything seems so... quiet here.\"\n\nMariana nodded in understanding. \"I know what you mean.\"\n\nThey stood there for a moment, the only sound the gurgle of the coffee beans and the distant crash of the waves. Mariana's mother sighed and came over to hug her.\n\n\"I love you, kiddo,\" she said.\n\nMariana hugged her back, feeling the familiar ache in her chest. \"I love you too, mom.\"\n\nAfter breakfast, Mariana decided to head out for a run. The cooler air and sound of the waves usually lifted her mood, but today she felt stuck. Maybe it was the conversation with her mom, or maybe it was just a buildup of frustration. Whatever it was, she aimed to shake it off.\n\nAs she ran along the beach, the sand slipping beneath her feet, she noticed a figure standing near the water's edge. The guy was leaning against a rock, staring out at the ocean. He didn't seem to notice her approach, and Mariana found herself stopping a few feet away, watching him.\n\nHe was older than her, with dark hair that curled slightly around his ears. His profile was chiseled, with a strong nose and defined jawline. Mariana felt a small flush rise up her neck as she realized she was staring. He looked... troubled, like something weighed heavily on his mind.\n\nAs if sensing her gaze, he turned to face her. Their eyes met, and for a moment, Mariana was speechless. The air seemed to thicken, and her breath caught in her throat.\n\n\"Hey,\" he said finally, breaking the silence.\n\nMariana forced herself to speak, her voice barely above a whisper. \"Hey.\"\n\nThey stood there for another few moments, the only sound the waves and the wind rushing past them. Mariana felt a sense of awkwardness creeping in, the way she used to feel at school before she found a group of friends who accepted her for who she was.\n\n\"Mind if I ask you something?\" the stranger said, his voice gentle.\n\nMariana shook her head.\n\n\"What is it?\" she asked.\n\n\"Do you feel like you're running away from stuff?\" he asked, his eyes searching hers. \"Because I think that's what I'm doing. I've been running for weeks, and I still can't catch up.\"\n\nMariana felt a surprise jolt through her system. \"Yeah,\" she admitted. \"I guess I feel like that too.\"\n\nTheir conversation flowed after that, like a river breaking its banks. They talked about everything and nothing, sharing stories and finding common ground. Mariana felt herself opening up in a way she hadn't in months, and it was like a weight had been lifted off her shoulders.\n\nEventually, they said their goodbyes, and the stranger disappeared into the crowd. Mariana stood there for a few moments, the ocean breeze carrying the scent of saltwater and... something else. Something faintly like freedom.\n\nAs she turned to head back home, she realized she felt different. The isolation, the loneliness, it was still there, but it no longer felt suffocating. Maybe, just maybe, she was running less and running more. The thought sent a thrill through her veins.\n\nMariana smiled to herself, the tension in her shoulders easing. She continued her run, the waves crashing against the shore, the wind in her hair, and the warm sun on her skin. She felt alive, and for the first time since her father's passing, she didn't feel so lost. \n\nAfter she showered and changed, Mariana decided to take a walk along the beach, hoping to clear her head. The sun was high overhead, beating down on her skin, but she reveled in its warmth. The cool ocean breeze carried the scent of saltwater and seaweed, a smell that always brought her back to her childhood.\n\nAs she walked, Mariana noticed a figure walking towards her from the opposite direction. It was the stranger from earlier, his dark hair mussed and a look of relief on his face.\n\n\"Mariana,\" he said, falling into step beside her. \"I'm glad I ran into you again.\"\n\nMariana's cheeks flushed, but she couldn't help smiling. \"I guess it's a small world, huh?\" she said, her voice light.\n\nThey walked together in silence for a few moments, the only sound the waves and their footsteps. Mariana felt a sense of comfort with him, like they'd known each other for years, not just a few hours.\n\n\"I'm Daniel,\" he said finally, breaking the silence.\n\n\"I'm Mariana.\" She offered a small smile.\n\nAs they reached a scenic overlook, Daniel stopped and looked out at the ocean. Mariana stood beside him, feeling a sense of calm wash over her. They stood there in silence for a while, the only sound the waves crashing against the shore.\n\nFinally, Daniel turned to her, his eyes searching hers. \"You're not like anyone I've met before,\" he said quietly. \"You have this... light, this radiance about you.\"\n\nMariana's heart skipped a beat. No one had ever said anything like that to her before. She felt a flutter in her chest, a feeling she hadn't experienced in a long time.\n\n\"I think I'm just glad to have someone to talk to,\" she said, trying to downplay the comment.\n\nDaniel nodded, his expression softening. \"I think it's more than that,\" he said. \"You're like... a glimpse of sunshine on a cloudy day.\"\n\nMariana's cheeks flushed, and she looked away, trying to hide the smile spreading across her face. She couldn't remember the last time she'd felt this way about someone. The ocean air was still and calm, and for the first time in months, she felt like she was exactly where she was meant to be.\n\nAs they stood there, the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the beach. Mariana knew this was something big for her, something she'd been waiting for without even realizing it. She turned to Daniel, her heart pounding in her chest.\n\n\"Would you like to grab dinner with me?\" she asked, trying to sound casual.\n\nDaniel's face lit up with a smile, and he nodded enthusiastically. \"I'd love to.\"\n\nAs the sun dipped below the horizon, Mariana knew she'd taken the first step towards healing, towards finding a part of herself she'd thought was lost forever. And she knew that with Daniel by her side, anything was possible. \n\nThe sun had fully set by the time they reached the small caf√© by the beach, the neon lights signaling the start of evening. Mariana felt a flutter in her chest as Daniel held the door open for her, a small gesture that spoke volumes.\n\nTheir table was by the window, offering a view of the ocean in all its glory. The breeze carried the scent of saltwater and food, a mix that made Mariana's stomach growl with hunger.\n\nAs they perused the menu, Daniel reached out and brushed a strand of hair behind Mariana's ear. The touch sent a shiver down her spine, and she knew this was a moment she'd remember for a long time.\n\nTheir conversation flowed as smoothly as the waves outside, covering everything from books to music to their childhood memories. Mariana laughed more than she had in months, the tension in her shoulders easing with each passing minute.\n\nEventually, Daniel suggested they order dessert, and Mariana agreed, trying to convince herself that she still had a small ice cream budget left. As they waited for their treats to arrive, Daniel reached across the table and took her hand, his fingers intertwining with hers.\n\nThe connection sent a spark through Mariana, like a live wire had been lit. She looked up at him, her heart pounding in her chest, and saw the same feelings reflected in his eyes.\n\nTheir dessert arrived, and for a few moments, they focused on the rich flavors and textures. But Mariana couldn't shake the feeling that she was walking a tightrope, balancing the familiarity of Daniel's presence with the thrill of the unknown.\n\nAs they finished their dessert and the check arrived, Daniel reached into his pocket and pulled out his wallet. Mariana watched, her eyes drifting upwards to meet his, and she knew she was about to make a decision that would change everything.\n\n\"So?\" Daniel asked",
