MARRIED TO A STRANGER\nMaria and I had been married for nine years. We met after a bad breakup and our friends thought we'd be a perfect match. We were young, from the same town, and shared a love for fishing. What could go wrong?\nWe built our life together, our love growing strong like the banks of the river. But as the years passed, the waters began to churn. I'd always been a wandering soul, restless and free, but marriage changed me. It tied me down, anchored me to one place. I felt lost, like the river had changed course overnight, leaving me stranded on the wrong bank.\nMaria thought this new restlessness was just a phase, that I'd settle back into our routine once I had kids. But I couldn't shake the feeling that I had taken a wrong turn, one that I wouldn't discover until it was too late.\nOn a quiet summer evening, as we sat on the porch, watching the sunset with our toddler, little Sophia, I had a sudden urge to pack up and leave. The thought of hitting the open road, of losing myself in the endless miles, took hold of me like a fever.\nBut as I gazed at Maria, her smile and laughter, I knew I couldn't abandon her. Not now, not ever. So I stayed, though the feeling grew, a slow-burning fire that threatened to consume me.\nSophia grew, and I became a more distant father, lost in my own thoughts. I'd promise to take her fishing, but never follow through. Maria would look at me with sadness in her eyes, thinking I'd simply lost interest. The thought twisted in my gut like a rusty gate.\nOne lazy afternoon, as the sun beat down on the hot pavement, I slipped out of the house, leaving a sleeping Sophia and a waiting Maria. I drove far from our small town, far from the weight of expectations and disappointed hearts. I drove until the open road ran out and I hit the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe salty air filled my lungs as I stood on the edge of the water, feeling the cool mist on my face. For the first time in years, I felt free. I'd been a stranger to myself for so long, and now, standing there, I felt a glimmer of recognition.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and the weeks turned into a small epiphany. I knew I'd have to leave, to take back control of my life, but not without Maria, without Sophia. I couldn't abandon them, even if I wanted to. The thought of facing Maria, of seeing the disappointment in her eyes, made my stomach turn. Could I justify leaving them behind, to find myself?\n\nThe sun set over the ocean, casting a golden glow on the waves, and I knew what I had to do. I had to go back. I'd found a small part of myself, but that didn't mean I could walk out on the life I had built. Not without fighting for it.\nAs I drove back to our little town, my heart felt like a weight on my chest. I thought of explaining my journey, of trying to articulate the emptiness I'd felt but I knew I'd come up short. Would Maria even understand? Would she forgive?\n\nWe pulled up to the house, the porch now bathed in the quiet of the evening. The front door creaked open, and Maria stood in the doorway, a hesitant smile on her face.\n\n\"I was worried sick,\" she said, holding back tears. \"Where were you?\"\n\nI took a deep breath, the words jumbled in my mind, \"Maria, I... I'm sorry. I needed some space, a chance to breathe, to figure some things out.\"\n\nThe air between us hung heavy, like a winter storm cloud. \"We thought you'd abandoned us,\" she said, her voice trembling. \"Left me with a baby and a broken heart.\"\n\nSophia, hearing the distress, began to fuss, and Maria stepped aside to calm her. I stood there, my heart pounding in my chest, and I knew, right then and there, that our marriage wouldn't be the same but it would continue. I realized I wasn't a free man, not anymore. I had a daughter, a wife, and a future waiting for me. The open road still called, but it was a distant hum now, a gentle reminder that some roads were better left walked rather than driven.\n\nAs Maria handed Sophia over to me, and I cradled her in my arms, feeling her warmth against my chest, I realized that marriage wasn't about finding a stranger to share your life with; it was about becoming a stranger to yourself, and finding a new way to love, even when the roads ahead were uncertain. I knew then that our journey was far from over, that together, we'd face the twists and turns of life, hand in hand, ready for whatever came next. And for the first time in years, I felt like I was exactly where I was meant to be. In a place of love and uncertainty, but with Maria and Sophia by my side, I knew that no matter where the roads took us, we'd walk them together, always together.\n---\n\n#shortstory#romance #families #marriage #loss #growth #selfdiscovery #love #relationships #familylife #parenthood #heartache #redemption #newbeginnings#hope #loveconquersall #adventure #inspirational #uplifting #emotional #movingforward #overcoming #vulnerability#connection #courage #forgiveness#healing #personalgrowth #change #evolution #selfacceptance #growthmindset#selfawareness #emotionalintelligence#selflove #innerpeace #courage #gratitude #selfcompassion #growth journey #personal development #love wins #hopeful #optimistic #motivational#positivevibes #goodvibes #love #life #hope #inspiration #motivation #dailyinspiration #lifequotes #lovequotes #familyquotes #marriagequotes #relationshipquotes #loveofmylife #momlife #dadlife #familygoals #loveofmyheart #myheart #loveofmylife #loveofmyheart#shortstory #romance #families #marriage #loss #growth #self-discovery #love #relationships #family life #parenthood #heartache #redemption #newbeginnings #hope #loveconquersall #adventure #inspirational #uplifting #emotional #moving forward #overcoming #vulnerability#connection #courage #forgiveness#healing #personal growth #change #evolution#selfacceptance #growth mindset#self-awareness #emotional intelligence#self-love #inner peace #courage #gratitude #self-compassion #growth journey #personal development #love wins #hopeful #optimistic #motivational#positive vibes #good vibes #love #life #hope #inspiration #motivation #daily inspiration #life quotes #love quotes #family quotes #marriage quotes #relationship quotes #love of my life #mom life #dad life #family goals #love of my heart #my heart #love of my life #love of my heart. And to you, may your path always be lit by love and understanding. may you cherish every moment in your journey, the pain and the sweetness. may you always find courage to forgive and learn, and may you walk hand in hand with those you love, as I do with Maria and Sophia. \n\nTHE END... 1000 + words later.. (laughs).... : )... 2023.11.09: 14.19 10.23 PM.. : )...... : )... Maria had been right, she hadn't been a stranger to herself. She knew I needed space, she felt it too. I was just scared of saying it out loud. But for some reason, this morning, I saw myself for who I was and maybe that's all that matters. Maybe love is not about being together all the time, but about making each other a home to return to. Maybe it's not about the destination, but the journey, hand in hand, like Maria and Sophia and I do. \n\nTHE END.. (I guess that's it, my first published short story.. 2023.11.09 14.19. : ). 23,11,09,.. My short story writing endeavor begins. Hope you enjoyed it. This has taken me months to write.. It would have taken much less time if someone edited me, but whatever. I'll learn. Next time, I promise some beta readers. It has to get better, and it will, but I'm glad that you enjoyed this. This is basically how my heart feels so, what is there to improve? Maybe I was too honest, but that's just the way it is. Can we chat about this in the notes section below?. \n\nPlease click the likes button below to let me know the journey has ended... THE END. (I made it, after months). I actually started this short story when my daughter was 2yo, Sophia is now 9. Life takes so much out of you, so little left to create, but then sometimes it flows in like the river that we fished in at the beginning of the story. I'm actually leaving to fish now. How poetic. Hope to catch some real nice fish. Good luck to you, I leave the best part of the river's water for you, for my next story. I promise it will be better. I know,",
