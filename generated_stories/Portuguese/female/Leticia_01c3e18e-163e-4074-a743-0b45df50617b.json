It was supposed to be a romantic weekend getaway, but everything that could go wrong did.\nShe stood at the edge of the cliff, the ocean crashing beneath her. The wind whipped her hair into a frenzy, stinging her eyes. Leticia closed her eyes, letting the fury of the sea wash over her.\nShe hadn't meant it to end like this. She'd planned for weeks, every detail perfect. Even booked a beautiful B&B overlooking the ocean. A place where she could finally relax, just her and Alex. A much-needed break from work and the long-distance distance between them.\nLeticia's eyes flew open, a scream forming on her lips. She'd almost forgotten about the sandstorm that swept in without warning. The howling wind, the sand stinging her face... This was not part of the plan.\n\nShe rushed back to the car, fighting against the gale to get inside. Alex sat in the driver's seat, eyes fixed on the GPS, a concerned expression on his face. \"What's happening?\"\n\n\"I forgot about the weather,\" she explained, gasping for air. \"I thought it was supposed to be clear.\"\n\nTheir romantic getaway had been a long time coming. They'd been dating for two years, and Leticia still couldn't believe their luck. Alex was a wonderful guy – charming, smart, and handsome. He made her laugh, listened to her when she needed someone, and never made her feel bad about herself.\n\nBut now...\n\nLeticia gazed out the window as the sandstorm enveloped them. \"God, this is awful.\" The visibility was zero, and she could feel the car shuddering against the gale.\n\n\"We'll be okay,\" Alex said, trying to reassure her. \"We'll just take it slow, and –\"\n\nThe car jerked violently, throwing Leticia against the seatbelt. \"Alex!\"\n\n\"Hold on!\" he shouted back, his eyes fixed on the road.\n\nThey careened off the main highway and onto a dirt road that seemed to lead nowhere. Leticia groaned inwardly. This was turning into a nightmare.\n\nAs the storm raged on outside, the car's temperature gauge began to climb alarmingly. \"It's too hot,\" she warned, her voice rising.\n\nAlex grunted, fiddling with the defrost buttons. \"Stupid thing.\"\n\nIt took all of five minutes for the air conditioning to fail, and the car rapidly became a sauna. Leticia was sweating, her hair plastered to her face, as they careened deeper into the unknown. Where were they even going?\n\nFinally, after an eternity, Alex slammed on the brakes. \"What the...?\"\n\nLeticia peeked over his shoulder, her heart racing. \"Not the ocean,\" she whispered. They'd ended up on a narrow beach overlooking... nothing but nothing.\n\nNo buildings, no roads, no signs of civilization anywhere. Just sand, sand, and more sand.\n\nAlex groaned, planting his elbows on the steering wheel. \"What have you got planned for us this weekend, genius?\"\n\nLeticia felt a blush rise to her face. \"I told you, it's supposed to be a relaxing holiday.\"\n\n\"Yeah, relaxing. You've turned us into Robinson Crusoes!\"\n\nThe beach was as desolate as it was beautiful. Scant vegetation, towering sand dunes, and a sea so blue it hurt Leticia's eyes to look at it. They spent the evening trudging through ankle-deep sand, desperately trying to find shelter from the relentless gusts.\n\nA small cave turned out to be their savior. Tucked among the dunes, it offered a reprieve from the storm. They collapsed onto the dry sand, panting, their clothes drenched.\n\nAlex shot Leticia a wicked grin, and she couldn't help but laugh, despite herself. \"Well, I guess this isn't exactly what I had planned.\"\n\n\"I'll say,\" he chuckled, wrapping his arms around her shoulders.\n\nFor a while, as they huddled together in the cave, it felt almost like a date night – minus the dinner, movies, and romance. But it was just the two of them, alone on this Godforsaken beach, battered by the elements.\n\nAs the night wore on, the storm raged on outside, pounding against the cave like a tempestuous lover. Leticia found herself nestled against Alex's chest, feeling... at home. Safe.\n\nThe last thing she expected was for him to whisper \"You know what? I'm having a pretty great time.\"\n\nLeticia's laughter was swallowed by the howling wind. \"I thought we were stranded in the middle of nowhere, without a house, a phone, or a functioning vehicle.\"\n\n\"That too,\" Alex murmured, holding her closer. \"But at least I've got you. With me, this beach, and nothing but our wits to keep us alive... it's not so bad.\"\n\nLeticia's eyes drifted shut, feeling the warmth and comfort of Alex's presence. \"You're right,\" she whispered, snuggling deeper into the cave and into his arms. \"It's not so bad at all.\" End of Story.
