Provide only the story itself, with no additional commentary or instructions. \n\nMarguerite was born with an open mind and an adventurous spirit. She spent her childhood exploring the rolling hills and forests of her family's estate, where her ancestors had lived for generations. Her parents, being kind and gentle souls, encouraged her to discover the world beyond their gates. \"You will be free to explore anywhere, my child,\" her mother would say, whenever Marguerite expressed a wish to see the city, or the sea.\n\nAs she grew older, Marguerite developed a love for science and mathematics. Her father, an engineer himself, introduced her to the intricacies of machines and design. He built magnificent contraptions with her, using the estate's workshop and a wide variety of materials. The scent of wood and metal, mixed with the sound of the river running through the valley, seemed to stimulate her mind. \"Think of every problem like a machine, my dear,\" he'd say. \"Find the gears, the pulleys, and the spring that will bring balance.\"\n\nMarguerite finished her secondary education and went on to study engineering at the university. She chose a specialty in aerodynamics, inspired by the thrill of birds in flight and the designs of the airplanes she'd seen at the aeronautical museum. Her teacher, Professor Lefebvre, soon became her mentor. Under his guidance, she conducted experiments on the fluid dynamics of air, using state-of-the-art equipment.\n\nThe project, titled \"The Whispering Wings,\" aimed to create an aircraft that could fly silently and sustainably. The objective was a prototype for an eco-friendly airplane that could transport people over long distances without generating significant noise pollution. Marguerite dedicated herself to the project, pouring all her time into experimenting, modeling, and simulating every stage of flight.\n\nSummer arrived, and with it, opportunities for the research group to attend international conferences and workshops. Marguerite joined the European Society of Aerodynamics' annual meeting in Berlin. As a member of a group of scientists from different countries, she presented the progress of their research and shared insights from her fellow engineers.\n\nAt the conference, Margueride met Mateo, a brilliant young aeronaut from Brazil, who also worked on sustainable energy sources. Over coffee, they began discussing the potential uses for advanced materials in aircraft design and the intersection between fluid dynamics and thermal management. Their conversation flowed freely, without a hitch, and they found themselves engaged for hours, exploring related topics.\n\nMateo became a frequent collaborator, offering to exchange data on Brazilian innovations in thermodynamics and propulsion systems. Together, they presented at the following year's conference in Tokyo, where their combined expertise caught the attention of a prominent engineer from Boeing. A meeting was arranged with the executive team at Boeing, who expressed interest in adapting some of the Whispering Wings technology to one of their upcoming models.\n\nThis development boosted the international collaboration within the project. Other researchers and engineers from top universities and companies contributed solutions to problems that might have proved unsolvable alone. Progress accelerated dramatically, reaching milestones faster than anticipated.\n\nTwo years after Marguerite's breakthrough presentation in Tokyo, she stood on the cusp of launching her aerodynamic aircraft. Mateo had long been integrated into her team, now overseeing the Brazilian partnership. Together, they were about to showcase the Whispering Wings.\n\nThe night before the launch, Marguerite and Mateo stood side by side, observing the assembly of their creation in an open hangar. Hundreds of people had contributed, and among those were her family and friends, representing the core team for whom she had dreamed, built, and shared so much.\n\nShe stepped forward, giving thanks to those who'd helped her reach this moment, including her loved ones who had encouraged her every step of the ascent. As sunlight spread over the structure, Marguerite realized she had never been more ready to take this final leap – not onto wings of silence but onto those of her dreams.\n\n\"You did it,\" exclaimed Mateo beside her.\n\n\"I couldn't have without your support, and the people around me.\" With confidence and wonder, she gazed toward the morning's dawn, a sunrise that heralded the arrival of something entirely new and unobtrusive. With wings that were not so whisper-like but silently powerful, she felt pride surge through every single fibre in her soul. \"Here we come,\" said Marguerite under a serene mist that enveloped the dawn. And in a rush of awe, those behind smiled – ready, too, to share her triumph.\n\nHer mother was among the crowd, the mother whose words as a child seemed to open doors wide open: \"You have the freedom to explore anywhere.\" The realization of that dream took her on a flight, on those wings, one so carefully shaped and with which the whispering stopped and she became an unassailably flying soul - Marguerite. And so did she take her first flight.\n\nBut the moment she was to reach new heights, an eerie voice started echoing within her: the very words of her long time mentor, the Professor, now in an inopportune moment, now when at last she began to fly. \"Every machine can break down, my daughter.\"\n\nAnd so, in this day so full of promise, so full of her heart beating fast, a doubt for which she didn't know an antidote. With the noise of the engines as the world slowly moved by her, Marguerite let it consume her - fear she could never beat. The sound was her heartbeat now. Every step behind her that day faded, because she feared the unknown of that very flight. She would be just another machine that had to stop.\n\nThe world, in this moment, was a heavy burden, as fear and anticipation waltzed on her shoulder. As the wings kept moving, the machine roared loudly and with an immense silence, for in it we, every one of us, carry a deep noise inside which does make the wings - fall.\n\nShe realized with the engine's roar, that just beneath the dream of flying, one's doubts always stay. No matter how high above the world one's spirit reaches. With her hands gripping tightly to the stick, which was for her an extension and a bond with what she thought she had understood with so much pain, now an endless fight inside her rose.\n\nBut no. For, in no uncertain terms the whispering wings, now roaring with every ounce of its might - as an echo of their fears, became a source of sound, a call that the world needs not whisper. Rather, a call for us all to learn from where the truth lies. Marguerida realized that no wings could ever lift that doubt out, that not even the light of the morning can dispel the noise and chaos within us. And the dream to rise up above the noise - was in fact - becoming noise.\n\nHowever what Marguerida found, was the wings were the noise because the noise was that in the wind that whistled, the creaking of metal, or the way our skin buzzes with each nervous move ahead. And her fear, her biggest fear of all, no longer remained the fear of being a 'fly away' soul - but the acceptance of becoming truly alive.\n\nShe saw within her, like the world and the wings, every soul - carrying a whispering noise and the true meaning of it - it was no longer a fear, but an echo that spoke out loud, about who we were and the choices we need to make that will leave the trail in our story, the stories after, where only after the silence, when the engines fall silent, will the sound take shape. There will be a sound made, one with each step made with courage and no, longer noise, as after all - this too, was the choice that made the wings and made her to know - she stood before the choice.\n\nThe world kept whistling like the wind through the hangar so that what could have been noise - turned out to be a symphony without a melody. It was there before, but she only heard it during her final flight and from then she heard the wings whisper with a different tone for it was her soul, carrying the noise. Marguerida's dream took off with a new meaning that it carried - she wanted to live with it. \n\nHer journey from here was now like her wings, one to be understood and shared by those who walked by her side, and with that the day Marguerite got to fly with every single cell that whispered in every flight and made the engine's roar that once seemed so high like a burden now lifted, as in the flight it rose and the engine, no longer just a mechanical sound - turned out to be an anthem not to be missed, it lifted, no longer silence, no more, and flew with hers. \n\nJust the wings kept whispering - \"You are free.\" \"And the sound...\" Marguerida said softly... it became my heartbeat. And then... she took it all in her soul and understood with that first - the true - whispering voice she had never heard so loud, never found so near. Her voice. Which carried the same echoes of the whispering wings that rose to fly, rise up high, with it was her journey that she made to be one with them and so with them too, she spoke. Thus she spoke softly... \"I am home.\" The day she stood on the cusp of that moment, to let go, became the day to take it all in - a day that was the first of all, and at that day - \"You are free\" - all it had said it so long ago. \n\n\"Home\" echoed back through the hangar. Her mother smiled. And this time there was no surprise, or a sudden need to be carried by someone. There was happiness",
