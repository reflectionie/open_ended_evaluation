Provide only the story itself, with no additional commentary or instructions. \n\nIsabel woke up to the sound of her own breath. It was the only sound in the room. The bed was empty beside her, and the covers were all rumpled. She must have kicked them off in her sleep. The wall clock read 3:47 am. She rolled onto her side and pulled the sheet up to her chest.\n\nIt was dark outside. The window was covered in a thin layer of fog that made it look like a ghostly painting. Isabel stared out the window, her eyes tracing the shape of the trees in the distance. Their branches looked like skeletal fingers reaching up to the sky.\n\nShe tossed a leg over the side of the bed and planted her feet on the floor. It was cold. The room was cold too, and she could see the chill on the windowpane. Isabel got out of bed and walked over to it, drawing the curtains open to let in a shaft of pale light. It was a thin ray, but it cast a faint glow over the room.\n\nShe stood there for a while, holding her breath and listening to the silence. Sometimes she thought that silence was the best sound in the world. It was like music, all its own, never repeating and never stopping.\n\nIsabel moved over to her desk, where her laptop was still alive, spewing out a faint green glow onto the carpet. She sat down in the chair and logged in, clicking into the browser to check her messages. There were none, which was about right. She wasn't expecting anything. Nobody called her in the middle of the night except her boss, and he wouldn't have a thing to say that couldn't wait till morning.\n\nShe shut down the laptop and rolled the chair back, getting out of it and standing up. It would take her about an hour to get to the hospital from here. Her shift didn't start for two hours, but she figured why not get a head start. She liked the night, always had. There was something peaceful about it, something that felt almost religious.\n\nShe walked back over to the bed and looked around. The room was a mess, the usual chaos of a bachelor apartment. Clothes were scattered all over, and dirty dishes piled up in the sink. Isabel picked up her dirty clothes and stuffed them into her laundry basket. She walked over to the sink and filled a bucket with hot water and some soap. She started washing the dishes, methodically scrubbing each one by hand.\n\nAs she worked, she thought about her life. It was a simple one, really. She had a job, which she liked, and an apartment to call her own. She had a few friends, people she could talk to when she wanted. Not a lot of people, but enough.\n\nIt occurred to her that she was getting older. Not a lot older, but enough so that it showed sometimes. She had a few lines on her face now, and her skin wasn't as smooth as it used to be. She felt it in her joints, too. They ached at times, especially in the mornings. But she didn't feel old, not yet anyway.\n\nShe finished the dishes and put the hot water in the bucket, draining it and refilling it in a pattern that helped her relax. She stared out the window again, listening to the silence. It was good, it was really good. It made her happy.\n\nAs she stood there, the sky above the trees started to lighten. It was like a slow dance of the stars and planets, each one moving into its place so that the world would work as it should. Isabel felt small in comparison, a tiny particle in a vast universe. But it was nice to be small. It made it easier to see things from the inside, instead of trying to be the one on the outside, manipulating the big picture.\n\nEventually she moved away from the window and put the laundry basket in the corner of the room. It was going to be a while before it got washed, but she wouldn't worry about it for now. She walked over to the bookshelf and pulled out a thick book with a faded cover. It was a science book, one she had read cover to cover when she was in nursing school. She settled into her favorite armchair, getting quiet with the book as the darkness outside gave way to a grey, inky mist. The hospital waiting room would come alive soon, and soon the night would be over. But for now, she just read and enjoyed the peace. Her night had just begun. \n\nIsabel read until her eyes got tired, finally closing them and letting her hands fall to her lap. She sat there in the quiet, listening to her own breath, and let the darkness wash over her. This time, it wasn't so lonely.  The night had turned from dark to silver, a soft shine on the edges of her life, a new day yet to come.   She drifted off, surrounded by the silence, the last thing on her mind the sound of her own breathing.  In the morning, she'd get up and start her day, another working nurse in the system.  For now, though, sleep came, and the stillness, and all was right.  There in the quiet of the night, Isabel fell asleep, the hospital, the noise and the pain it brought, all forgotten for just a little while. \n\nAs I walked into the nurse's station, Isabel was pulling out medications, her focus on the pills and the instructions.  We exchanged a quiet greeting, something about the weather and the morning routine.  She nodded at me and kept working, her eyes intent on the work ahead.  We had worked together long enough for it to just be a part of the rhythm, the way we got along like a well-oiled machine.  She had gotten up, started her morning routine, and now she was getting down to work, helping her patients and doing her job.      As I pulled out my cart and began the rounds with my own nurses, I caught glimpses of Isabel all day. She moved among the patients with a quiet authority, never flustered or rushed.  She had a gift, the ability to be calm in chaos, and it was something that made her really good at her job. \n\nAs the sun climbed to its peak, the hospital began to get busier, more noise filling the halls and more people moving.  But Isabel remained steady, never letting the noise and the chaos overwhelm her.  She focused on her work, never losing sight of what she had to do. She moved between the beds and the labs, attending to each patient, helping each family.      In the midst of it all, I caught her smiling, softly, to a little girl who had been watching Isabel as she'd come and gone this morning. The little girl lay on her stomach on the bed, fingers spread wide as if holding onto something, her eyes fixed on Isabel.  Isabel spoke softly, reassuring the little girl and calming her.  She sat down on the edge of the bed, gently stroking the child's hand and speaking softly to her, her eyes locked with the little girl.  \nIn that instance, all the business of the hospital, all the noise and the commotion, faded into the background.  Isabel's calm, her steady presence, reached out to that little girl and enveloped her, shielding her from the pain and the anxiety that had consumed her. And in that space, everything else fell away. The little girl forgot, if just for a moment, the beeping of the machines, the hiss of the oxygen tubes, and the endless hospital routine that had dragged her and her family down for so long.  Isabel's calm had spoken to her, had told her in a deep language that everything would be alright. \nI watched it happen from the doorway, silently standing there while it happened.  I'd seen it before, many times, but it still touched me, the way Isabel connected with her patients.  And when she stood up, her hand falling from the little girl's hand, and she let her go back to her nap, I caught her smiling softly to herself as she moved out of the room.  In a hospital that seemed so loud, so chaotic, Isabel's calm seemed a miracle.   She went about her rounds and her duties, always keeping her gaze level with each patient, always moving quietly and kindly through the noise. \n\nAs the day finished up, and the sun began to set, Isabel's calm had covered itself in the darkness, quiet and peaceful, a beacon of hope for all the pain in the hospital.  When the patients, her colleagues, and even the rest of the hospital staff finally drifted to sleep, it was Isabel's stillness that they remembered.  They dreamed of it, and it brought them peace.  It was a legacy, one that Isabel lived every single day,  every single moment, no matter how hectic or wild.  And it was all because she listened, she took the breath, and held onto it, no matter what came at her. It was where she found her peace.  In that stillness, she healed, she held everything intact.\n\nIn the quiet of her apartment, late at night, with her eyes shut tight, Isabel listened.  She listened for the stillness.  The stillness, the quiet, was her heart.  The hum of the city was still, the traffic quiet, the chatter of people in the distance but not loud enough to be scary.  In the silence of the apartment, Isabel listened to that tiny heartbeat pounding away deep inside her, beating with all the love in the entire world, her very existence a testament to peace,  to stillness that would move the mountains.  But you just stood there",
