Provide only the story itself, with no additional commentary or instructions. \nAs the sun set over the city, Carlos made his way through the crowded streets of downtown. He had just left his shift at the diner and was looking forward to spending some time relaxing at home. The scent of greasy burgers and fries still lingered on his clothes, a constant reminder of the day's work.\nAs he wove through the pedestrians, Carlos couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. He had been walking home this way for years, and yet somehow it never got any easier. The streets always seemed to be alive with energy and motion, and he often found himself dodging elbows and backpacks as people rushed to and fro.\nHe spotted the small alleyway that led to his apartment building and made his way towards it, grateful for a brief respite from the throngs. The alley was narrow and poorly lit, with stacks of crates and abandoned boxes that seemed to stretch on forever. Carlos dodged a discarded water bottle and began to climb the steps leading up to his building.\nThe door slammed shut behind him, and Carlos leaned against it to catch his breath. It was a quiet relief to step into the dim, musty hallway, where the only sounds were the creaking of the old elevator and the hum of the fluorescent lights overhead.\nHe trudged the length of the hallway, finally arriving at his apartment door. He unlocked it with a creak, and stepped across the threshold into the warmth and comfort of his own space.\n\nOr, at least, he thought it was comfortable.\n\nThe air inside was thick and stale, and Carlos wrinkled his nose in distaste as he stepped deeper into the room. He flicked a switch, and a faint buzz of the air conditioning unit sprang to life, the chilled air momentarily clearing the air of the evening's cooking smells.\n\nCarlos made his way into the kitchen, scanning the countertops for any remnants of last night's attempt at cooking. He had been attempting to make ramen noodles, but ended up with a pan-scared mess on the walls, floor, and every inch of the surrounding counters. It was, mercifully, most of last night's dinner still intact, stuck like a bad omen to the ceramic that he couldn't even bring himself to scrape off.\n\nThe kitchen was... chaotic. The words Carlos's landlady might have used to describe it.\n\nHe opened the fridge and was greeted with a scent of yesterday's Chinese takeout, a six pack of stale beers lingering unopened in the doorway, and what appeared to be last week's science experiment at the very rear shelf, masquerading as a leftover pizza.\n\nFor all his complaining, Carlos had grown accustomed to this place – the smell, the clutter, and all. As a child, his family had lived in a cramped apartment with an even tighter budget, and this place felt like paradise, really.\n\nWith a sigh, he opened the pantry and was greeted by the usual assortment of canned goods, stale ramen, and... oh, that bag of \"mystery spice\" that had a shelf life rivaling ancient Egyptian tomb construction.\n\nThe evening wore on, Carlos rummaging for something edible in his pantry. A combination of frustration, disappointment, and half-hearted optimism finally settled into determination, and he grabbed the takeout containers, scrubbing out as much moldy grime as he dared from the pizza. It reeked. Oh, boy.\n\nHe set the stove on a new setting – or at least, he tried – not quite remembering which setting it should be set on, but confident it could never burn. That is, it usually didn't.\n\nCarlos set about rummaging through cabinets, knocking over cans and dusty mason jars in search of an onion (which ended up being three jars back in storage), salted some wilted lettuce with dubious success (at best), and – after two close shaves with setting fire to the oven, an incident he was quietly certain would never happen again – succeeded in cooking what they came to call a \"burned-hamburger-burger.\"\n\nIt resembled something a child would vomit up during a particularly feverish bout of flu. It resembled a \"certain artistic vision,\" as some culinary enthusiast might choose to describe it. A fusion of flavors that somehow – to Carlos, at least – tasted mildly familiar, but probably not.\n\nIt was dinner.\n\nAnd as he sat on the edge of the armchair, with an air of \"well, at least it didn't eat me...\" hanging like a dark cloud above the evening, it really did taste alright.\n\nA tiny flicker of satisfaction warmed his belly as he polished off two heaping slices, washing it down with that warm beer from last week – half- drunk at this point – the faintest notion of hope rising in his heart that perhaps tomorrow would bring something better.\n\nMaybe next time, his food won't resemble a chunky, smoldering cinder from the apocalypse, he thought, snickering quietly as dust flew through the open window, landing softly on the crumbs of the burnt dish. \n\nTomorrow.\n\nIt all starts tomorrow. With a new day, new chances, and maybe – who knows? – even a few extra dollars in his pocket to spend on something other than stale cereal, takeout from the corner bodega, and pizza that was left cold in the refrigerator for two years, maybe even buying a nice new bottle of hot sauce or that perfect bag of coffee one day.\n\nSomething had to change, right? But for now... tomorrow, right?\n\nTomorrow. That sounds... actually not so bad at all.\n\nThe evening drifted away under the faint glow of table lamps, the TV, still off, silently observing everything from the dark. It was almost nine, and a soft blanket of late-night fog had curled over the city, mopping up all harsh sounds. Carlos just sat in the darkness, his stomach full, his soul numb, an air of quiet numbness, of resigned relief settling over him like a damp, grey wool, but somehow, just... for once, not feeling like the most terrible day in humanity.\n\nAnd he sat, the silence filling room for miles, sipping that same, cold beer in happy bliss, not feeling altogether doomed this time, until the lights simply went off, extinguishing all the rest.\n\nAnd so, the night ended with that warm, happy silence. For Carlos. The night was dark, soundless, and safe. But that was okay. It would, after all, be a brand new day tomorrow. Tomorrow can be full of nice things. Tomorrow is... full of possibilities. \nAnd, so, Carlos drifted into a dreamless sleep that night, content, somehow, and almost hopeful. Almost. But tomorrow, right? It all starts tomorrow. And, in Carlos's eyes, it promised a bright, better world. Or at least, one less smoky, burnt, less- than-perfect than the ones before. Or maybe even with new kitchen utensils, one that did cook and perhaps, finally cooked decent stuff... the very notion, though, was nothing but just that – a future possibility.\n\nTomorrow. Carlos looked to it excitedly, somehow confident as sleep closed over his weary head, as if it had somehow really become possible to get things right. At least it was a start – a small, yet hopeful one, perhaps one even with a bright new beginning... for even he. For the very first time. Maybe. Maybe even... Tomorrow. Tomorrow, though, promised change. Not quite clear, still a mystery, and so shrouded, like the city fog, still very far in the distance, yet closer with every passing moment that led into that day, that morning, and one night that was, right after this very moment, right after tonight... The morning after. Always. And so the city just kept on rolling... on and on. That night, though. For that quiet man, at the edge of all things he knew had to be changed so as to make things new – it looked rather very promising, and seemed to tell him just those few simple words in the vast, endless, dark, and stillness of all the night... Tomorrow, Carlos would get it right. In a world of chance, all he was doing, after all, was trying. And Carlos, that late night after the endless days he faced, finally, for a moment in his fragile little life, felt something he almost never did. And that was, well, hopeful.\n\nAs the morning of the next day finally did come, or at any rate, began to arrive... The city outside and all that it brought, seemed all of a sudden to stir and wake with renewed promise, or perhaps just more darkness and noise, though that was no reason either, for Carlos to wake, the darkness lifting, like the city fog, now clearing and the morning air, full of life itself – was just the right time. He could already sense it, so as that all the things around him and the city itself came alive, and new day now rose and spread over things, full of endless, and infinite hopes, even for his small part within it... Just one, in the vast and beautiful symphony... And the first sounds of each of his morning would not come without something else... for the dawn was breaking... and his alarm clock was ringing out, to be its very, very own announcement of a new day.\n\nAnd with a soft, peaceful morn, when the darkness slowly disappeared – after a long, restless, and very quiet night – Carlos at last awoke, his heart still pounding from the ringing, and it became clear, through the darkness of his sleepy eyes to know he could hear the stillness around him. A stillness so profound that with a mere lift to his head over his pillow he could simply",
