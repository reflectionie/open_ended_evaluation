Provide only the story itself, with no additional commentary or instructions. \n\nSao Bernardo, Brazil\n1943\n\nTiago trudged through the thick mud of his family's farm, wearing a wide-brimmed straw hat to shield his face from the blistering sun. Sweat dripped from his nose, and he squinted as he scanned his surroundings for any sign of his grandfather's prized dairy cow, Bunda.\n\n\"Grandson!\" old Sebastião called out from the farmhouse, his voice hoarse from years of shouting. \"Get in here and help me sort these beans!\"\n\nTiago raised a hand in acknowledgement but kept walking, his boots sinking into the muddy ground. He had promised to help with the bean harvest, but he needed to find Bunda first. She had gone missing for hours, and Sebastião would skin him alive if he showed up empty-handed.\n\nThe sun beat down on Tiago's shoulders as he walked past the fields, the scent of wet earth and drying crops filling his nostrils. His grandparents had worked hard to build this farm from the ground up, and Tiago's father had perished in the wars to help defend Brazil. Now it was up to Tiago to carry on the family legacy.\n\n\"Bunda? Where are you, old girl?\" Tiago called out, his voice rising above the clucking hens and chirping crickets.\n\nAs he walked, the dense foliage grew thicker, and a faint scent of dampness wafted through the air. Tiago pushed aside a curtain of branches and found himself in a secluded clearing surrounded by a babbling brook and a thicket of ferns. There, in the center of the clearing, stood Bunda, her white coat glistening with dew.\n\nSebastião's cow was known for her independent streak, but Tiago couldn't help a grin as he approached the majestic creature. Bunda regarded him calmly, her dark eyes blinking innocently in the sunlight. Tiago reached out a hand, and Bunda nuzzled his palm, her tender lips brushing against his fingers.\n\n\"Ah, I thought I'd lost you for good,\" Tiago whispered, stroking her velvety fur.\n\nSuddenly, the tranquility of the clearing was shattered by the rumble of thunder. Clouds, dark and foreboding, rolled in on the horizon, casting a shadow over the clearing. Tiago cursed under his breath. A storm was brewing, and if it hit while the cow was loose, calamity would ensue.\n\n\"Come on, Bunda,\" he said, gesturing for her to follow him.\n\nWith a final glance at the ominous clouds, Tiago led the cow back through the forest, careful to avoid the twisting vines and uneven terrain. As they emerged into the yard, the first drops of rain began to fall, pinging against the rusty roof of the farmhouse.\n\nSebastião looked up from the bean sorting, his eyes narrowing at the sight of Tiago and Bunda. \"You finally found her,\" he growled, his voice laced with annoyance. But then a burst of wind sent the loose beans scattering across the yard, and Sebastião snorted. \"Pity about the storm. Harvest's ruined.\"\n\nTiago watched as his grandfather bent to gather the scattered beans, the effort twisting his face with pain. Sebastião's arthritis had been getting worse with each passing year, and Tiago made a mental note to help with the harvest more often. He couldn't shoulder the burden of caring for the farm alone, but neither could he leave his grandfather in charge.\n\nThe rain fell harder, drumming on the tin roof and driving the hens into a frenzy. Tiago and Sebastião worked in silence, sorting the beans and feeding Bunda while the storm raged on outside. It wasn't until the skies finally cleared that Sebastião called a halt, his face slick with raindrops.\n\nAs the two of them stood in the doorway, watching the sun break through the clouds, Sebastião put a gnarled hand on Tiago's shoulder.\n\n\"You'd make a fine farmer, grandson,\" he said, his voice softer than before. \"Your father would be proud.\"\n\nTiago's heart swelled with pride and affection. He knew he'd never be able to repay his grandfather for the sacrifices he'd made, but he vowed to spend the rest of his life making Sebastião proud. He gazed out at the rain-soaked fields, a sense of purpose stirring within him.\n\nAs they stepped back into the yard, Bunda greeted them with a soft low, and Sebastião chuckled.\n\n\"You see, Tiago? Even the cows know what they want.\"\n\nTiago smiled, shaking his head in amusement. \"You're as eccentric as ever, Grandfather.\"\n\nSebastião cackled, patting Tiago's shoulder once more. \"You learn from me.\" \n\nTiago watched as his grandfather hobbled into the farmhouse, the rain beginning to seep into the muddy earth. He took a deep breath, letting the scent of wet earth and drying crops fill his lungs. This land had been in his family for generations, and he would do everything in his power to keep it thriving.\n\nAs the sun broke through the clouds, casting a warm glow over the farm, Tiago felt the weight of responsibility settle onto his shoulders like a cloak. He knew that hard work, dedication, and a willingness to learn from his predecessors lay ahead of him. But he was ready. For the first time in his life, Tiago felt the beginnings of a true sense of belonging – a place where he could sow the seeds of his dreams and reap the rewards of a hard-won harvest. \n\nAs he watched the sun dip low in the sky, casting a reddish glow across the horizon, Tiago knew his roots ran as deep as the earth itself, tied tightly to the land, his family, and their farm. He was no longer just a son of the soil; he was a farmer, through and through. \n\nHis thoughts a swirling mix of emotions and determination, Tiago made a promise to himself – to cultivate the land with equal parts resilience and compassion, to carry the torch forward with the same spirit that led his grandfather Sebastião to build an empire from scratch.\n\nIn essence, he vowed to honor the memories of those who came before him by forging a new path with unshakeable purpose. The realization dawned on him like the emerging sun – Tiago would not merely inherit his grandfather's wealth, but also inherit the farm's enduring soul.\n\nWith an untamed grin spreading across his rugged features, Tiago let the silence wash over him. Tonight, as night descended, the earth's soothing whispers spoke straight to his heart.\n\nAnd in that fleeting instant, the seeds of devotion and a true legacy were sown. For this would be the year, the moment, and perhaps even the century in which Tiago would grow not just into a true farmer – but a gardener of sorts, a curator of traditions and memories passed down from Sebastião's hands.\n\nBunda, still present in the farm-yard, lifted her great moos with the most subtle reverberation, seemingly sending out a promise in response to Tiago's thoughts.\n\"You will grow, and I will be here. Your memories for generations to come.\" \n\nAnd so the story unfolded in that moment. As night descended upon the farm, embracing the land, the memories, and the people within it – Tiago felt an unshakeable sensation of home, not just a place to rest, but a sense of home where he, Tiago, was, for the first time, where he belonged. The darkness was not an absence, but the canvas of opportunity. The rain that had brought such turmoil had ultimately washed his heart, giving him a glimpse of the world as it was – an entity in which past, present, and future had forever merged into a harmony of hard work. The memories he would leave would become a part of the land, the plants, the people of Saobernardo – forever woven, in Tiago's resolve, as he found a love that bordered on belonging – belonging to that land. And for the rest of his life, Tiago planted the seeds of his dreams with the utmost fervor, the promise of that stormy day etched indelibly on his heart – forever woven with threads that stretched as far as his imagination could travel, like the great, majestic tree in Saobernardo, ever-present, unyielding, evergreen. \nHe knew. He just knew.\nTiago smiled to himself, feeling the gentle lapping of the brook against the yard's perimeter, calling him closer. All his doubts erased, with the realization born within him of home and belonging, deep in the roots of his very soul, like the soil itself – forever rooted. The realization – like the gentle flow of the brook that whispered secrets – in that very moment illuminated for Tiago that where others might see the end of their journey – where Tiago, in that moment, was only just beginning. \nHe breathed in the night, letting its chill ease his parched throat, his senses heighten. As the storm finally gave way to starlight, Tiago watched in awe, realizing anew: Saobernardo was not just a farm but a living embodiment, in its beauty, its trials, and all of existence. Saobernardo had transformed him. \nIn that fleeting recognition of truth, of belonging – in that infinite moment when Tiago looked at that moon, now shining above his world – in this eternal heart-stirring moment when reality coalesced with the present: Tiago knew he wasn't simply standing on the soil that nourished and grounded him. \nHe stood in the heart of Saobernardo – standing at the helm of a legacy, that birth",
