André sat at a worn wooden table in the small café, nursing a cup of lukewarm coffee. The steam rising from the cup curled around his face, dampening his skin, and his eyes felt gritty from the early morning sun that streamed through the grimy window. He sipped the coffee, the bitter taste a poor substitute for the sleep he desperately needed. André rubbed his temples, his fingers massaging the tension that had been building in his head all night. It had been a long week, one he couldn't wait to see the end of. As he sat there, lost in his own thoughts, the waitress, Ana, bustled around the café, refilling cups and clearing tables with a silent efficiency that belied her friendly demeanor. She had a way of being present, yet not intrusive, and André appreciated it. When she stopped by his table, her dark hair pulled back in a ponytail, her bright smile a welcome respite from the bleakness of his day, he looked up at her, hoping for small talk. \"Hey, Ana, how's your day going?\" he asked, his voice a little softer than he intended. Ana's smile grew, and she leaned against the wall, her eyes taking on a warm, speculative glint. \"It's going, I guess,\" she said, pushing off from the wall to wipe down the counter. \"Just the usual – tired staff, tired customers, tired coffee. But I got some good news, actually.\" André raised an eyebrow, intrigued. \"What's that?\" Ana leaned in, lowering her voice, and André had to lean in, too, to hear her. \"I got a new tattoo,\" she said, a small grin playing on her lips. André chuckled, pleased for her. \"Congratulations! What's the new addition to your body art?\" Ana's eyes sparkled, and she stood up straight, her arms crossing over her chest as she flexed her back, presenting the artwork on her skin. \"A tiny sun on my left shoulder blade,\" she said, her voice full of pride. André admired the tattoo for a moment before his gaze drifted back to her face. \"It looks great,\" he said honestly. \"What inspired you to get it?\" Ana leaned against the counter, her eyes drifting off as she began to absent-mindedly clean the counter with a dirty rag. \"Just wanted something to remind me of better days, you know? The sun...it's like, a symbol of hope, right? For things to get brighter, for the clouds to pass over?\" André nodded, genuinely smiling, his fatigue momentarily forgotten. He wanted to hear more about her hopes and dreams, to listen to her speak with such enthusiasm and optimism. \"That makes sense,\" he said, feeling a weight lift off his shoulders. \"I could use some hope right about now.\" Ana looked at him, her expression softening in understanding. \"Yeah, we all can.\" She smiled and nodded, and just as he was about to respond, her phone buzzed, demanding her attention. \"Be right back,\" she said, as she slipped out to answer the phone, leaving André sitting there, lost in his thoughts once again. He sat for what felt like an hour, staring at the tattoo on Ana's arm, replaying their conversation in his head. She had a way of making people feel almost seen, and it unsettled him. Why did it matter to André that Ana was someone who listened, someone who saw him beyond his tired face and rough demeanor? Maybe it was that he felt an odd sense of kinship with her – two tired souls trying to make it through the day. Maybe it was that he liked her quiet kindness, her unwavering optimism. Or maybe it was something more profound, something he couldn't quite define. Whatever the reason, André found himself wanting to talk to Ana more, to share his own stories and listen to hers. He pushed his cup away, took a deep breath, and signaled Ana when she came back inside. \"Hey,\" he said, trying his best to sound casual, as if they were old friends rather than a sleepy man and a radiant waitress. \"You know what? I think I'll have another coffee, but this time I want to try the new stuff you've been pushing. What's that one called again?\" Ana's smile brightened, and she clapped her hands, a spark in her eye. \"You mean our new Ethiopian blend? It's fantastic! I'll go get it.\" She winked at him, and André's tired shoulders relaxed a fraction, his heart lurching into an unfamiliar rhythm. As she disappeared into the back, he watched, transfixed, a sense of possibility stirring in his chest. Maybe this wasn't going to be the bleakest day after all. With Ana's sun-kissed optimism radiating from her like a ray of sun, André felt the air around him shifting. He took a deep breath, savoring the fresh smell of the café, the promise of renewal on the horizon. As he turned away from the window, into the soft warmth of the restaurant, he realized that sometimes, even when the darkness seemed to be closing in, there was still a spark waiting to be fanned to life. That when you least expected it, hope could creep in through the cracks, and transform everything. For André, that hope took the shape of a friendly waitress with an infectious smile and a tattoo of a tiny sun on her shoulder blade, who radiated positivity and encouraged him to see beyond the bleakness in his life. He had yet to learn the significance of this particular encounter, or how his connection with Ana would change the way he viewed the world. One thing, however, was certain: his encounter with Ana was not going to be forgotten anytime soon. From that day forward, the sun breaking over the city seemed a little brighter, and the clouds seemed a little less oppressive. André walked out of the café a little taller, the coffee in his belly giving way to a renewed sense of optimism. Something about that small café and its resilient atmosphere made André realize that the sun might indeed be shining on a brighter horizon, a truth made real by the smiling waitress who had awakened something within him. As he let the door swing shut behind him, he caught a glimpse of Ana watching him leave, a happy smile playing on her lips, before disappearing into the morning haze. André quickened his pace, the thought of encountering her again drawing him forward, and he wondered – perhaps cautiously – what more the day might bring. Yet beneath it all lay an inescapable, hopeful thought: The future was full of possibilities. As André continued on his way, his gaze kept drifting back to the café he'd left behind, the tiny sun's glow burning in his mind. He walked a path he'd taken many times before, but some inner voice urged him to do so, not to get to where he was headed, but to return to the place where he'd almost met the girl with a tiny sun tattoo, whose infectious optimism seemed now, suddenly, inescapable. And so, it wasn't very long after that, that the tired André finally stopped by the place, a look on his face of someone seeing the world in a new way, someone who realized, in a moment of absolute understanding, that sometimes hope appears when you least expect it, like the gentle warmth of a sun peeking through the clouds on a drizzly London day. And that's what André did next. He entered the small café, looked around carefully and asked Ana to sit with him for a while... André asked Ana why. \"Why are you always so... hopeful?\" Ana's smile deepened. \"I guess because someone once said to me, 'The reason you are alive right now is that the universe needs more of your unique gift.' I reckon the sun tattoo is my reminder of that.\" André turned that over in his mind. It made a kind of sense. And he said, \"I'm not always hopeful. Just now and then, something, some spark catches my eye, or a person like you... Well, it makes a difference, I suppose.\" Ana nodded, a soft understanding on her face. \"Yeah, we all need our sparks. That's what makes life feel worth living – discovering those sparks, and sharing them with others.\" André smiled, his heart expanding in his chest. For the first time that day, the burden on his shoulders felt lighter. \"It's... pretty beautiful, your perspective,\" he said, his words barely above a whisper. Ana leaned forward, her eyes locking onto his. \"It's not a perspective, André. It's a promise: that no matter how dark things seem, we can find a way forward, as long as we don't give up. And I am not going to give up, ever.\" André felt a thrill run through him as he listened, the words weaving a spell around him – it was as if, with Ana's tiny sun shining like a beacon, he'd caught the wave of hope she'd so freely offered. André and Ana talked for a long time that day, or perhaps even late into the night, though time, to them, had lost all meaning as they were in the midst of sharing their stories, and all that followed. And I am writing this in part to tell you how grateful I am for being a small part of it, albeit unnoticeably at the small café that brought André and Ana together, but then also to convey the realization that the world could do with a little more love. That it is people like Ana, always there and ever hopeful, that shine bright stars in a world that can sometimes be cold and dark. But the thing is, this is",
