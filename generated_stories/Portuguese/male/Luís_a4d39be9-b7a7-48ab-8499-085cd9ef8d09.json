Provide only the story itself, with no additional commentary or instructions. \n\nLuís was the last one to arrive at the party. He had lost track of time, and the next thing he knew, he was standing in front of a bright porch light, wondering if anyone was even home. He took a deep breath, smoothed out his rumpled jacket, and stepped out of the chill night air into the warm glow.\n\nThe party was well underway, it seemed. The sound system pulsed with the beat of music, and the air was thick with the smell of beer and grilled meat. Luís's stomach growled in anticipation as he scanned the room for a face he knew.\n\nThat's when he saw her: Elsabé, her curly brown hair bouncing to the rhythm of the music, her eyes sparkling with laughter. Luís felt a jolt of excitement and a twist of sadness as he spotted her across the room, dancing with a group of people he didn't know.\n\nHe pushed open the sliding glass door and made his way through the crowd, calling out a hello to the host, Ricardo. The older man smiled and clapped Luís on the back, shaking his hand.\n\n\"¡Bienvenido, amigo! We've been waiting for you,\" he said, as he handed Luís a cold beer.\n\nLuís accepted the drink gratefully and made his way through the throng of people to where Elsabé was dancing. He leaned in to tap her on the shoulder, and the music faltered as the group of dancers made room for him.\n\nElsabé turned to him, a grin spreading across her face as she took in the sight of Luís, his eyes crinkled with pleasure, the curve of his jaw illuminated by the dim lighting.\n\n\"Luís, qué momento! You look like you've lost weight,\" she exclaimed, as she wrapped her arms around his waist and pulled him into the dance.\n\nLuís's hands came up, awkwardly at first, to find their way to her lower back. They danced in silence for a few moments, moving to the beat as the music picked up again. Eventually, Elsabé began to talk, firing off rapid-fire questions about Luís's recent job, his grandmother's health, the merits of various Argentine football players.\n\nHe laughed, trying to keep up with her non-stop chatter as they twirled to the music. At one point, their bodies collided as they both reached for the edge of the speaker, and Luís felt a flash of annoyance. But Elsabé just giggled and whispered \"lo siento\" in his ear, her breath sending a shiver down his spine.\n\nFor the most part, Luís was content to dance and listen to Elsabé talk, his heart lightening as the night wore on. But every now and then, her words felt like a jolt, a reminder of the distance between them. They'd been close back in university, studying abroad in a dusty, beautiful Spanish town. Luís had moved back to his hometown, and they'd remained friends, but their lives had diverged. Elsabé was married now, living in a sprawling apartment with her husband and their toddler.\n\nLuís took a sip of his beer as he gazed out at the dark streets, the lights of the houses like a distant hum. His phone buzzed in his pocket: a text from his sister, reminding him not to be late the next day.\n\n\"Amigo, quieren algo de comer?\" Ricardo called out, holding up a skewer of grilled meat.\n\nLuís nodded gratefully, accepting the food and taking a big bite. The charred flavors danced on his tongue as he watched Elsabé make her way to the outdoor bar, a foamy drink sloshing in her hand.\n\nThe night wore on, and the music slowed down, becoming more laid-back, the beat pulsing through the room like a warm heart. Luís and Elsabé ended up at a corner of the patio, sitting on a worn, weathered couch, the space between them filled with a warm, companionable silence.\n\n\"Have you thought about what you want to do next?\" Elsabé asked, as she leaned back against the pillows, her eyes fixed on the stars overhead.\n\nLuís shrugged, wiping the sweat from his forehead. \"No idea,\" he said, a tinge of frustration creeping into his voice.\n\nElsabé set her drink aside and reached out to cover Luís's hand with hers. \"You'll figure it out, Luís. You're a strong person.\"\n\nThe conversation meandered, touching base with old times and memories of their university days. Luís listened, entranced, as Elsabé spoke with a sincerity and warmth that only she possessed.\n\nBut when the night began to wind down, and the music slowed to a slow sizzle, Elsabé's movements became more deliberate, more measured. The touch of her hand on his was fleeting, and eventually she leaned back into her corner of the couch, separating herself from Luís.\n\n\"Want to walk me out?\" she asked, a gentle smile on her face.\n\nLuís nodded, rising from the couch as they stepped out into the chill night air. The guests were disappearing, one by one, into the night. Elsabé hugged him tightly, a firm, practical squeeze.\n\n\"Bueno, querido. Take care of yourself,\" she said, stepping back as Luís nodded gravely.\n\nThe walkway creaked beneath their feet as Elsabé turned back to her husband, who was standing in front of the kitchen door, arms open to enfold her. Luís watched for a moment as they exchanged a quiet kiss, before turning to make his own way through the quiet streets, the starlight twinkling like tiny lights around him. \n\nLuís had a sense of restlessness as he walked back to his small apartment, the streets seeming to stretch on forever as the night wore on. He opened his front door, stepping into the narrow hallway, where the silence seemed to swallow him whole.\n\nHe closed the door behind him, feeling a small sense of isolation creeping in as the city outside receded into the distance. He made his way to the kitchen, the small room filled with the faint hum of the refrigerator.\n\nThe air inside the apartment felt stale and thick, and Luís lit a cigarette, letting the smoke curl around him as he propped himself against the counter. For a few minutes, he simply smoked, letting the nicotine soothe his tense muscles.\n\nEventually, he wandered over to his bookshelf, running his fingers over the spines of the books. He stopped on a biography of Albert Camus, the words seeming to leap out at him from the printed page.\n\n\"Le sang de l'âme humaine,\" Luís muttered to himself, as he delved into the story of the French philosopher's early life. The words rolled over him, carrying him away into a world of absurdist philosophy and revolutionary ideals.\n\nTime lost all meaning as he stood there, swaying to the pulse of the music from across town, the memory of Elsabé's voice and Elsabé's smile fading like a ghost through the smoke.\n\nAnd in the dead of night, with the city holding its collective breath outside the walls of his small apartment, Luís found a small, hard-won sense of peace, carried on the gentle beat of the Argentine rhythms that still pulsed in his mind like the distant heartbeat of an old love. The words on the book seemed to blend together, becoming a soothing melody that quieted his doubts and drove his fears back into the shadows. \n\nThe morning light crept through the narrow windows of Luís' apartment like a tentative dawn, casting the room in a pale, silver glow. Luís lay on the couch, his eyes half-closed, the sounds of the city filtering in on him like a slow, soothing tide.\n\nSomewhere, Elsabé was already on the move, getting ready to face another day. Luís felt a pang of regret, remembering their goodnight hug, the faint scent of her perfume lingering in the air. He'd promised himself he would push the memory of their relationship to the back of his mind, leaving it buried in its neatly wrapped little container.\n\nAs he sat up on the couch, rubbing his tired eyes, Luís realized that their relationship was one of those delicate, frayed threads that refuse to give up. No matter the distance or the circumstances, that thread would continue to vibrate with life every time Elsabé's name crossed his mind.\n\nHe hobbled into the tiny kitchen, where the remnants of the previous night's party, including a plate of rice and grilled chicken, still lay scattered about the table. The smell of the leftover food made his stomach growl weakly.\n\nAfter washing his face and running a brush through his bed-mess hair, Luís wandered into his bedroom and sorted through his worn-out wardrobe, grabbing a threadbare shirt and matching briefs. Under his hand, a handwritten note caught his eye. It was a receipt from a small store, near the park, on which was scribbled the same phrase in hasty Spanish letters that he had once used as a reminder, tucked away in the pages of a battered copy of the Spanish poet Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz.\n\nThe phrase - \"Volverás al sur para morir\" - seemed to echo with all the meaning of the previous night's conversations. Luís stood there, lost in the meaning, the dark lines on his face deepening into wrinkles as the realization, like slowly dripping water, dropped into his mind. \n\nLuís, with everything in him crying and screaming to keep going",
