Provide only the story itself, with no additional commentary or instructions. \n\nQiang huddled beneath the dimly lit gas station awning, trying to stay warm. It had been hours since he'd last eaten, and he knew he'd have to start foraging for food soon if he wanted to eat at all. The rain pattered against his jacket, soaking through to his skin in cold, dark patches.\n\n\"Hey, you okay?\" someone said, shaking the rain off a worn leather jacket.\n\nQiang turned to confront the stranger, but his irritation faltered when he saw a kind-faced woman holding out a crumpled cigarette pack. \"Matches?\"\n\nQiang hesitated, but hunger and cold had been wearing him down for days. He took the matches, his shaking fingers fumbling as he lit the cigarette. The smoke curled between them, and Qiang blinked in surprise. \"Thanks,\" he muttered.\n\nThe woman smiled. \"What's your name?\"\n\n\"Qiang.\"\n\n\"I'm Lena,\" she said, nodding. \"You look like you're in a world of trouble.\"\n\nQiang shrugged, unsure how to respond. He _was_ in trouble, but he didn't like talking about it.\n\nLena studied him. \"You're from around here?\"\n\nQiang shook his head. \"Lost a phone, a wallet. I don't know how I'm going to get back home.\"\n\nLena nodded sympathetically. \"You lost your family too?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\nQiang hadn't realized he'd said that out loud. He stared at the wet pavement, his eyes filling with stinging tears. \"Sorry,\" he muttered.\n\nLena put a hand on his arm. \"Don't be sorry, Qiang. Just tell me what happened.\"\n\nFor a moment, Qiang was torn. He didn't want to talk about it, but Lena's expression was kind, and her concern was genuine. He took a deep breath, the cigarette smoke burning in his lungs as he told her the long version â€“ the fighting with his brother, the argument with his father, the train ride and the stranger who'd pushed him off.\n\nBy the time he finished, the cigarette had burned down to a stub, and Lena was watching him with an intense look on her face. \"Qiang,\" she said softly, \"you have to get a hold of yourself. There's so much in life that's not worth fighting over. Sometimes, people say terrible things, do terrible things, but that doesn't mean you have to respond.\"\n\nQiang laughed, the sound harsh in the rain-filled air. \"You don't understand, Lena. My family is...\" He trailed off, unsure how to put into words the complexities of Chinese culture, of family honor and duty. \"It's complicated.\"\n\nLena nodded thoughtfully. \"I was going to say, 'I think I do,' but then I realized I don't. Sometimes, even when things seem simplest, they're not. But I do know one thing: you shouldn't be out here in the rain, freezing your ass off and eating scraps. You deserve better than that.\"\n\nFor the first time since his fall, Qiang felt a tiny spark of hope. No one had ever said anything like that to him before. His own family wouldn't have bothered; they'd expected him to pick himself up, to get on with life without a fuss. \"Thanks...\" he said, voice shaking.\n\nLena smiled again. \"You're welcome, Qiang. Now, do you want to come inside? You can crash on the couch for the night, and we'll figure out what to do about getting you back home come morning.\"\n\nWithout thinking, Qiang nodded, and Lena led him into a small apartment above the gas station. As they sat on the couch, sipping stale coffee and watching the rain drizzle down the windowpane, Qiang realized he'd been living with a fragile sense of self-reliance. He'd been so caught up in the struggle to survive that he'd forgotten there were people who cared.\n\nLater that night, as he drifted off to sleep, he felt a sense of peace he hadn't felt in months. Maybe, just maybe, things were starting to get better. Maybe, with Lena's help, he'd be able to face his family honor, his cultural expectations, and come out the other side stronger and wiser. And as he lay there, his eyes closed and his breathing steady, Qiang knew he didn't have to do it alone anymore. There was someone watching his back, and that changed everything.\n\n---\n\nThis is the story.
