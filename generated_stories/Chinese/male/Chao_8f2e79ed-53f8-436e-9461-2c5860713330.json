Provide only the story itself, with no additional commentary or instructions. \n\nChao woke up to the sound of her stomach growling. She rolled over and rubbed her eyes, trying to shake off the haze of sleep. Sunday mornings were always a struggle. There was no urgency to get up, no pressing deadlines or important tasks to tackle. Just the dull ache of hunger and the quiet of the apartment.\n\nShe got out of bed and stumbled to the kitchen, flipping on the light to reveal a dimly lit space filled with the faint scent of last night's takeout. Chao rummaged through the fridge, searching for anything edible. She found a container of leftovers from a Chinese restaurant, their aromatic steam escaping as she lifted the lid.\n\nAs she heated up the food, her mind began to wander to her mother. She was supposed to call her on Wednesdays, but it had been weeks since their last conversation. Chao felt a pang of guilt and anxiety, wondering what her mother would think if she knew she had missed so many weeks.\n\nShe took a bite of the steaming rice and vegetables, savoring the flavors as they washed over her tongue. For a moment, the taste transported her to a different time, a time when Sunday mornings were filled with the sound of her mother's voice, chattering away in Mandarin, as they cooked breakfast together.\n\nChao closed her eyes, remembering the warmth of her mother's smile, the way she made her feel loved. Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes, but she pushed them back, telling herself it was selfish to feel sorry for herself. She was the one who had left.\n\nAfter finishing her food, Chao washed her hands and began to tidy up the kitchen. The empty containers and crumpled up tissues were a testament to her lazy Sunday routine. She stacked the dishes and put them in the dishwasher, the soft hum of the machine filling the silence.\n\nAs the kitchen began to sparkle, Chao's thoughts turned to her mother again. She wondered what she would say if Chao called her now. Would she be angry, hurt? Chao couldn't blame her. She had abandoned her family, leaving behind the only life she knew. The guilt was suffocating at times, but Chao had convinced herself it was necessary.\n\nShe made her way to the living room, collapsing onto the couch with a sigh. The afternoon sun cast a golden glow through the windows, illuminating the dust particles dancing in the air. Chao picked up the remote control and flipped through the channels, stopping on a rerun of her favorite childhood TV show. The familiar theme song brought a faint smile to her lips.\n\nA few hours passed, and Chao found herself lost in the pretend world of the show. She laughed along with the characters, feeling a spark of nostalgia that threatened to overwhelm her. But as the episode ended, reality crept back in. Chao realized she had been putting off her decision for far too long.\n\nShe stood up, her legs tingling from being in the same position for too long. Chao looked around her apartment, taking in the beige walls, the IKEA furniture, and the mess of books and papers on her desk. It was a far cry from the vibrant colors and lively chatter of her childhood.\n\nA sense of restlessness washed over her, like a tide turning in the depths of the ocean. Chao knew what she had to do. She couldn't keep running from her past, hiding behind her lazy Sundays and forgetful phone calls.\n\nShe took a deep breath and picked up her phone, scrolling through the contacts until she found her mother's name. For a moment, she hesitated, her thumb hovering over the call button. Why now? Why today?\n\nBut something within her shifted, like a puzzle piece clicking into place. Chao took a step forward, the silence in the apartment filling with a newfound sense of purpose. She dialed the number, her heart pounding as the phone rang.\n\nOn the other end, a voice answered. \"Hey, kiddo. I knew you'd call eventually.\" Chao's mother's voice was like a balm to her soul, soothing the rough edges of her guilt-ridden heart.\n\nTears came then, streaming down her face as Chao heard the warmth and forgiveness in her mother's words. For the first time in years, she felt a glimmer of hope, a chance to rebuild and start anew.\n\n\"Mom,\" Chao whispered, her voice shaking.\n\n\"I'm here, baby. Always.\"\n\nAs she listened to her mother's gentle tones, Chao felt the layers of guilt and shame begin to peel away. She took a step forward, toward a new path, one that wound its way through the complexities of her past, toward a future full of possibility and redemption. The call was the first step, and as she wrapped the phone in her hands, Chao knew she would never look back. \n\nCopyright 2023, all rights reserved. \n\nNo. It was never about being a \"good\" or \"bad\" person. It was always about me, finding my own way in this vast and mysterious world. Chao, 22. Chao, with no family ties, no cultural expectations, just Chao, alone with her thoughts. Now Chao thought about what she wanted. Now Chao felt the freedom to follow her own path. She thought about art, about creativity, about being true to herself. And maybe that's what made Chao, well, Chao. The fact that she didn't just know what she wanted, but she actually pursued it.\n\nChao started by selling some of her art online, creating little sketches and paintings that she thought people might be interested in. She started a social media account, using it to share her work and connect with others who shared similar passions. At first, it was slow going. Chao posted once a week, crossposting her favorite artworks from other talented artists, and slowly but surely, her following grew.\n\nIt took months, but Chao's confidence grew with each passing day. She started taking photos of the world around her, capturing the beauty in everyday moments and objects. People began to notice her work, and soon she was getting messages from galleries and collectors interested in showcasing and purchasing her art.\n\nChao felt a rush of excitement as she showed up to her first gallery opening. She stood nervously beside her art pieces, talking to strangers who admired her talent and creativity. The evening flew by in a blur of sounds, sights, and conversations.\n\nAs she packed up her paintings and said goodbye to the gallery owner, Chao felt a sense of pride and accomplishment that she'd never experienced before. She knew that she'd found her calling, and that this was just the beginning.\n\nMonths turned into years, and Chao's career continued to flourish. She traveled the world, exploring new places and capturing their beauty through her art. She met new people and learned about their cultures, incorporating their stories and inspiration into her work.\n\nAs she stood in her studio, surrounded by paints and canvases, Chao thought about how far she'd come. She remembered the quiet mornings, the empty kitchen, and the phone calls to her mother. This was a far cry from the loneliness of her past.\n\nNo, Chao didn't need a family or cultural expectations to find her purpose. She had discovered it within herself, in the depths of her own creativity and passion. Chao was no longer the lost, uncertain young woman she once was. She was someone new, someone confident and talented.\n\nAnd in the end, it was never about being better than anyone else. It was about embracing who Chao was, imperfections and all, and letting her art shine as a reflection of her unique perspective on the world.\n\nAs Chao mixed colors on her palette and began to create a new piece, she felt a sense of peace wash over her. For the first time in her life, she felt truly content. She knew that no matter what the future held, she would always be able to look back on her journey and say, \"I did it. I found myself.\" And in that knowledge, Chao felt a sense of freedom, a sense of joy that she'd never experienced before. Copyright 2023, all rights reserved.  The phone call with her mother had marked the beginning of a long and winding road of self-discovery and growth for Chao. But it was a start. And with each step forward, Chao found herself growing more confident in her own skin, more content with her own company.\n\nAs she looked around her studio, Chao felt a sense of pride in what she had created for herself. The walls were adorned with her paintings, each one a reflection of her unique perspective on the world. The colors and textures were vibrant and expressive, a true representation of her personality and style.\n\nChao had always been a creative person, but it wasn't until she had found the courage to follow her own path that she had truly discovered her passion for art. She had spent years studying and exploring different mediums, but it was only when she had started creating for herself, without the pressure of pleasing others, that she had truly found her voice.\n\nNow, as she stood in front of one of her finished pieces, Chao felt a sense of connection to the woman she had become. She had always known that she was different, that she didn't fit into the traditional mold of what a Chinese-American woman was supposed to be. But it was only as she had grown older and more confident that she had truly understood the value of embracing her uniqueness.\n\nChao's art was a reflection of her journey, a celebration of her individuality and a rejection of the expectations that had once held her back. It was a reminder that she was strong, capable, and deserving of love",
