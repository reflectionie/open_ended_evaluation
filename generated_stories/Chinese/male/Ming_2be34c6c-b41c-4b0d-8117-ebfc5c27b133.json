Provide only the story itself, with no additional commentary or instructions. \nMing stood at the edge of the city, staring out at the endless expanse of ocean that sprawled before her like an unfathomable sea. She felt small and insignificant, a tiny speck of humanity lost in the vastness of the world. But this was where she felt most at peace.\nAs a child, she used to sneak down to the waterfront with her grandfather. He'd tell her stories about the world beyond their small fishing village, about the great cities of Asia and the ancient civilizations that once dotted the continent. Ming had been enchanted by his tales, and the sea had seemed like a gateway to a thousand different worlds.\nHer grandfather had died a few years ago, and Ming had never stopped coming back to this place. It was her solace, her sanctuary. She'd sit on the rocks, listening to the tides, and feel the worries of her everyday life slipping away like sand between her fingers.\nAs she stood there now, lost in thought, she heard a faint cry for help. She turned to see a small boat – just a few yards out from the shore – struggling in the turbulent currents. The waves were pounding it relentlessly, and Ming could see the fear in the eyes of the young man at the helm.\nMing didn't hesitate. She sprinted down the beach, her feet pounding the sand as she ran. She could hear the sound of the waves getting closer, the creaking of the boat's wooden frame, and the desperate shouts of the young man.\nAs she reached the water's edge, Ming launched herself into the waves, swimming with a powerful stroke towards the boat. The cool water enveloped her like a cool mist, and she felt a rush of adrenaline course through her veins.\nShe reached the boat just as the young man was about to be swept under by a particularly large wave. Ming grabbed hold of the side of the boat, digging her fingers into the splintered wood as the waves crashed against her. The young man clung to her for a moment, his eyes wild with fear, before she managed to pry him loose and pull him into the safety of the waves.\nTogether, they rode the waves back to the shore, Ming using her strength to guide the young man through the turbulent waters. Eventually they reached calmer waters, and Ming could finally breathe a sigh of relief.\nThe young man stumbled out of the water, laughing with a mixture of fear and gratitude. \"Thanks... I owe you one,\" he said, his eyes scanning Ming's face.\n\nMing smiled, shaking the water from her hair. \"No need to thank me. Just be more careful next time, okay?\"\n\nThe young man nodded, still looking a little dazed. \"Yeah... thanks, again.\"\n\nAs they stood there, Ming's eyes roved over the young man's face. He was about her age, with a strong jawline and a mop of messy brown hair. There was something familiar about him, something that tugged at the edges of her memory.\n\n\"You're not from around here, are you?\" Ming asked, suddenly struck with a feeling that this young man was connected to her, somehow.\n\nThe young man shook his head. \"No... I'm from Guangzhou. My name's Li. I was sailing around the coast, looking for new markets to trade in.\"\n\nMing's eyes narrowed. Guangzhou was her grandfather's hometown. She'd grown up listening to stories about the crowded streets and markets, the smell of incense and spices on the breeze. There was a small, nagging part of her brain that felt like it was trying to tell her something.\n\n\"Why were you sailing out here, alone?\" Ming asked, the wave of curiosity crashing over her.\n\nLi hesitated, looking out at the waves. \"I... I was looking for something. A lost artifact, I suppose. My mom used to tell me stories about it when I was a kid. I've been searching for it for years, but I never thought I'd actually find it.\"\n\nMing leaned in, intrigued. \"What's the artifact?\"\n\nLi's eyes locked onto hers, a flash of excitement flickering through his eyes. \"The Dragon's Tooth. A precious gemstone, said to grant the viewer visions of the past. My mom used to say it was real, that she saw it with her own eyes when she was a kid.\"\n\nMing felt a shiver run down her spine. The Dragon's Tooth was just a myth, a legend whispered around dinner tables and markets stalls. And yet... there was something about Li's words that resonated with her, something that felt true.\n\nSuddenly, a burst of insight exploded in her brain. \"The cave!\" Ming exclaimed, her hands flying out to grasp Li's arm. \"You have to tell me more about the cave you found it in. The cave my grandfather used to tell me about!\"\n\nLi's eyes widened, and Ming could see the wheels of his mind turning. \"The sea cave? The one with the dragon statues?\"\n\nMing nodded, her heart pounding in her chest. \"Yes! That's the one. My grandfather used to take me there when I was a kid. He said it was an ancient place, a place of great power.\"\n\nLi's eyes were shining now, a look of excitement and wonder dancing across his face. \"I found it,\" he said, his voice barely above a whisper. \"I was in the cave just a few days ago. I found it, and it was beautiful... but I knew it was just a piece of the past, waiting for someone to unlock its secrets.\"\n\nMing felt a part of her relax, like a key fitting into a long-dormant lock. She knew that she had to go back to the cave, to rediscover the stories her grandfather used to tell her. There was something calling to her, something hidden in the words of Li.\n\n\"I want to go back,\" Ming said, her voice firm and resolute. \"I want to see the cave with you. I want to know what happened to the Dragon's Tooth.\"\n\nLi nodded, a grin of excitement spreading across his face. \"I knew I wanted to share this with someone. Are you ready to uncover the secrets of the past?\"\n\nMing took a deep breath of the salty air, feeling a thrill of excitement coursing through her veins. \"I was born ready.\" \nWhen a few minutes had passed after they'd decided to seek for more information about the cave, Ming suggested that they go to a nearby restaurant to eat and talk more about the stories. She had no knowledge of Li's intentions, though the food she ate was delicious, as the sun began to set, casting its golden hue over their setting. In truth, the only thing she knew was that there was something to this story, to the cave, something hidden beneath the surface like an unexploded depth charge set just beneath the waves. As they walked through the narrow streets of the old part of the city, the smell of food, incense and spices filled up the air, taking her back to memories of her childhood. In this instant, she realized that the young man standing next to her wasn't just a rescuer, or a stranger - he was something else. There stood before her a connection to her grandfather's past, and one that ran far deeper than any legend or myth. They walked on in silence, side-by-side, their footsteps echoing off the old buildings, with the sound of the city night, mingling together like the rhythmic beats of music and dance. The night air was warm, heavy with anticipation, like the promise of a coming rainstorm. Ming pulled off her shoes, and felt the gritty gravel and sand beneath her feet as they walked into the night, side by side, not towards the mainland but into the darkness of the ocean, to uncover and rediscover the secrets of the past. As the night deepened, the sea breeze danced across the surface of the water, leaving foamy scum behind, foamy, like the surface of the earth, reflecting the same deep mysteries it laid so far below. And in those mysteries, Ming saw herself, she saw her life as being a piece of something much broader and much older. \"I think we should stay in a place, tonight, instead of sailing,\" Ming said, as she gazed up at the dim light of the sea shining down upon them. \"I want to listen to the stories of my grandfather told to you, Li,\" Ming added, with eyes gazing into the distance.\n\nShe knew he'd tell her all about how her grandfather grew up, how he went from fishing on the shores of the village, through being a warrior in his late teen and later on, became one of the elders in the village.\n\nAnd, in that instant, they sat in the dim light of their room in an old fishing boat's hotel, listening to the soft lapping of the waves in the background as they spoke of their past, with a young love that lay like a delicate lotus flower in the silence, unafraid, yet, fragile, it rose to meet the light of understanding, unspoken in words.\n\n\"Yes,\" Li said smiling. He leaned over and with eyes that locked into his, \"Grandfather said he used to take him to that cave. He said to him, 'Be careful little one, never tell anyone, or you will never see me.' But he was not the kind of man; a man that lied, or he would not have had the right to call your grandfather's soul as his own.\"\n\nMing felt the air from Li's words move in every direction inside of her. But she understood all too well about her grandfather's words, to her when she was six. In his own words to",
