The sky raged above like a beast awakened from a long slumber, its fury unrelenting. Lightning flashed and thunder boomed, shaking the small village below. Ming crouched beside his mother, her eyes fixed on the small shrine they had built together. A cold breeze swept through the village, carrying the scent of wet earth and ozone. In this stormy chaos, Ming’s thoughts were consumed by the loss of his sister, Leiyin, who had vanished into the darkness a fortnight ago. His mother’s hands were clenched into tight fists, her lips pressed together in a silent scream as the roof of the shrine danced with the wind. A gust crashed through the village, extinguishing the lanterns and plunging the streets into darkness. Ming’s mother huddled closer to him, her body trembling with each crack of thunder. He wrapped his arms around her, trying to offer what little comfort he could. The night wore on, the storm raging on without respite. As the hours ticked by, Ming grew more restless. His thoughts drifted from his sister, to the endless fields of rice outside the village, and to the mysterious stranger who had appeared before the villagers, promising solutions to their troubles. That was when Leiyin had gone missing. Some said the stranger was a spirit, come to take the child’s struggles upon himself. Others whispered that he was a wizard, manipulating the villagers for his own gain. Ming couldn’t decide, but one thing was certain: he wanted answers. He carefully stood up, freeing his mother’s arms from around him. He made his way out into the storm, his face upturned to the sky as if daring the lightning to strike him. His mother’s voice followed him, begging him not to go out, but he ignored it, his heart pounding with determination. As he emerged from the village, the wind nearly knocked him off his feet. Ming stumbled, but managed to regain his balance. He squinted against the driving rain, his eyes scanning the fields and forests beyond the village. He remembered the stories his sister had told him about the spirits that roamed these lands, how they could be good or evil, depending on the intentions of those who called upon them. But Ming wasn’t seeking out ancient guardians; he was searching for the stranger who had promised Leiyin answers. The stranger had a name: Jianli. Ming remembered the words he had spoken before disappearing into the night, telling the villagers to “look for him beneath the shadows that hold him.” Ming had been too young to fully understand, but now, with Leiyin gone, he felt an aching need to find Jianli and demand the truth. The storm raged on, the lightning flashing like fire that flickered but never truly went out. Ming pushed forward, his feet squelching into the wet earth as he navigated the empty fields. The shadows of the rice stalks stretched long and ominous, but Ming pressed on, drawn by some hidden thread of hope or desperation. He saw movements out of the corner of his eye, and turned to find the spirits from his sister’s stories: dark, ghostly figures that flickered and dissipated as quickly as they appeared. The wind carried their whispers, their soft sighs a cold murmur in Ming’s ear. And then, like an arrow shooting through the night, a single figure detached from the landscape. He was older than Ming, with eyes that seemed to hold the weight of time and the depths of the universe. “Ming,” the stranger’s voice was barely audible above the thunder, “I have been waiting.” Ming took a step forward, the stranger holding out a hand to calm him. As the two closed in on each other, a shadow seemed to unfold between them, taking root in the space beside the stranger. The air grew colder, and Ming saw Leiyin, her eyes flickering open as if she had just emerged from a lightless world. Her gaze locked onto her brother, and Ming’s breath caught in his throat. He had never seen such a radiance emanating from his sister. “Leiyin,” he whispered, his voice shaking. “Where have you been?” For a moment, the storm paused, the wind dying down, and the lightning sizzling in fits and starts. Then Leiyin spoke, her words barely louder than a sigh on the wind. “Beneath the shadows that hold him.” Ming turned to Jianli, his eyes blazing with questions. But the old man only smiled, and nodded faintly. In that moment, Ming realized that some truths were better left unspoken, and that some family secrets were too dark to bear. The storm re-erupted, its fury unleashed as the stranger and the sister vanished into the shadows, leaving Ming alone and bewildered, yet ever so slightly at peace. When the villagers found him hours later, he was curled beside the shrine, his eyes open to the stormy sky. They carried him back home, his heart, though battered, quiet, his thoughts – forever changed – in silence.<|eot_id|>",
