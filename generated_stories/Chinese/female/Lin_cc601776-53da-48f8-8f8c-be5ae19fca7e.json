Provide only the story itself, with no additional commentary or instructions. \n\nLin stood at the edge of the ocean, the wind whipping her hair back as she gazed out at the waves. It was a chill, grey day, the kind of day that made you want to curl up with a good book and a warm cup of tea. But Lin wasn't there for relaxation. She was there for a reason.\n\nShe had been waiting for this day for what felt like an eternity. A day when she could finally say goodbye to the life she'd left behind and hello to a new one. A day when she could start fresh, with no reminders of what she'd lost.\n\nLin's eyes burned as she thought of her sister, Lena. They'd shared everything since they were kids, from sweet treats to secrets and dreams. But it was Lena who had been taken from her, her life cut short in a tragic accident that had left Lin shattered and heartbroken.\n\nThe pain still felt like a fresh wound, sometimes. There were days when it felt like it had been only yesterday that she'd received the news, and other days when it felt like a lifetime had passed since she'd seen her sister's smile. Lin closed her eyes, feeling the wind buffeting her face. She needed to hold on to this new day, to the hope that it represented.\n\nShe remembered the last time she'd seen Lena, the way she'd hugged her tight, telling her how proud she was of the person Lin was becoming. And then, just like that, it was all over. Lin's eyes snapped open as she felt a stinging sensation in her eyes. She hadn't expected the grief to hit her like that, on this of all days.\n\nBut she had a purpose now, a mission to fulfill. Lin took a deep breath and began to walk along the beach, the grains of sand squishing between her toes. As she moved further away from the water's edge, the pain in her chest began to ebb, replaced by a sense of determination.\n\nShe had been living in her parents' home for months now, ever since the accident. But as much as she loved them, she knew it was time to move on. Time to start her own life, on her own terms. Her parents had been hesitant at first, worrying about her, but Lin could see the relief in their eyes when she'd spoken about moving out, about making a new life.\n\nIt wasn't easy for her either. The memories of Lena lingered everywhere in that house, from her laugh-filled bedroom to the spot on the couch where Lena had loved to snuggle up with a book. Lin's heart swelled with love and loss as she thought of those moments, but today was about the future, not the past.\n\nShe had a small apartment waiting for her, just a short drive away. It was modest, but it was hers, a place where she could be alone with her thoughts, where she could start to heal. And that was what this day, what this entire journey, was all about.\n\nAs Lin walked further along the beach, the wind began to carry scents she'd grown accustomed to – salt and seaweed and some other smell she couldn't quite place. She breathed them in deeply, and suddenly her vision cleared. She could do this, Lin told herself. She could start over, could be free.\n\nHer phone buzzed in her pocket, startling her from her reverie. She hesitated before pulling it out, her heart sinking as she saw her mother's name on the screen. Lin usually avoided her phone on days like this, fearing the familiar touch of familiarity and sentiment. But this time, something inside of her shifted. This time, Lin felt ready to face whatever was waiting for her on the other end of that line.\n\n\"Hi, Mom,\" she said, her voice sounding stronger than she felt.\n\n\"Not too far along, I hope?\" her mother asked, her voice warm and caring.\n\n\"I'm here,\" Lin replied. \"Just getting away, like I wanted.\"\n\nThere was a pause on the other end of the line, and for a moment, Lin worried she'd made a mistake. But then her mother spoke up. \n\n\"I know it's hard, dear, but take that final step. You can do this. You were born to start anew.\"\n\nTears pricked at the corners of Lin's eyes as she listened to her mother's words. This was the moment, the push she needed to break free. And maybe, just maybe, this day would be different. Maybe it would be a new beginning.\n\nLin took another deep breath, standing tall and strong as she gazed out at the ocean. The waves crashed against the shore, reminding her that life was constant, unpredictable, but beautiful. And in this moment, Lin knew that she was ready to ride those waves, to dive headfirst into whatever awaited her.\n\n\"I'm scared,\" Lin admitted, her voice barely above a whisper.\n\nThere was silence on the other end, but it wasn't a negative one. It was a soothing acceptance, like her mother knew what she was going through. \n\n\"That's normal,\" her mother said softly. \"But you have a strength in you, Lin. The same strength Lena had. And it's time for you to use that now.\"\n\nLin took another step forward, feeling her footprints sink into the sand as the waves rolled in behind her. She thought of Lena, of the laughter, memories, and the smile that she'd always been able to summon, even on her worst days.\n\nTears streamed down her face as Lin looked out at the vast expanse of ocean before her. It was beautiful, heart-wrenching, but above all, it was a reminder that there was so much life to be lived. And Lin was ready to live hers.\n\n\"It's okay, Mom,\" she said, turning to face the unknown.\n\n\"I'm proud of you,\" her mother replied.\n\nThere was nothing more either of them needed to say. Lin had found the courage to take that final step toward a new beginning. Now, it was time for her to take her first step. \n\nLin wiped her eyes, letting out a slow breath.  She looked out at the waves again, and this time, it wasn't with a sense of longing, but with resolution. She was ready to walk into the sun, to start all over.\n\nThe ocean, it seemed, had given her a beautiful gift – the strength to let go, to start anew, and to find a new version of herself. Lin closed her eyes, taking one final glance at the stretch of the beach behind her, knowing she would never go back to the person she used to be. \n\nWith a newfound sense of purpose and promise, Lin walked toward the horizon. One step at a time, toward an uncertain future, where she could be more of herself, and become something new, beautiful, and unique. \n\nShe took her first step, onto a brand new journey, ready for whatever lay ahead. And with each step, she carried a little more of Lena in her heart with her. She knew it was okay, because a part of her was free – her grief released, like a bird flying into the sky.\n\nAnd the ocean whispered secrets to her as she walked by the crashing of waves, \"Everything is waiting for you — the unknown, the excitement of it all, and the thrill of the ride.\" And for a moment, Lin felt free. The wind and the sun, everything around her melted into a new vision – a vision that welcomed her with open arms, inviting her to explore the depths of unknown waters, filled with promise and uncertainty. \n\nAs Lin kept walking, she laughed, releasing a small tremble of the past, and that familiar lump in her throat began to dissipate. For a moment, she forgot that she had tears on her face, as the cry of birds, seagulls, and other seaside sounds filled her ears, creating a sense of unity, and a gentle sense of the start of a new life.\n\nAnd that was when Lin knew - everything was a little more hopeful today. Everything seemed to be turning into gold – tears transformed to rain showers on her skin, creating ripples and patterns of hope and peace. Her heart ached less; her heart felt lighter and cleaner – less burdened with what's past. She realized that even grief can be an opportunity to start fresh.\n\nWhen Lin's eyes finally turned toward her new home, she smiled. The uncertainty felt familiar now; a friend that awaited her on the other side. The distance that had once felt oppressive now felt like a small hurdle. She felt the sun's gentle touch, and the breeze in her hair as a blessing.\n\nAs Lin stood there, taking one final look at the expanse of open waters, the realization settled in her soul. The beauty of what she now saw was that a new chapter in her life, and in her journey with her sister's memory, had begun. Her steps, strong, determined, took her toward an unfolding canvas in the future. A moment had finally arrived – where grief, hope, and tears swabbed at the surface. \n\nA moment to hold on to a memory of Lena that shone like a morning star. Lin realized that in the depths of her pain, in the midst of her anguish, there existed a power she'd never known existed within her until now – the ability to love herself and walk, without expectation, into an unknown future. \n\nAnd in that precise moment, as she let go of what held her back – her past, her fears, her grief – she was met with an acceptance so unconditional that tears in her eyes dried instantly – and in their place, hope emerged from her broken heart.\n\nIn her new home, far from the place of memories they shared, Lin chose her first book",
