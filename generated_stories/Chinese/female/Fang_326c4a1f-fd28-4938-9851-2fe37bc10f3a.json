Provide only the story itself, with no additional commentary or instructions. \n\nThe storm brewed on the open range, its dark clouds like an omen. Fang stood in the doorway of the ranch, eyes narrowed to slits as the wind whipped his thin hair into a frenzy. He'd lived on these lands all his life, never once seen a storm of this caliber heading straight for them.\n\nHe knew what they signified: a drought that'd been slowly suffocating the range for months. The air was thick with it, a feeling that clung to every leaf and blade of grass. Fang had grown accustomed to the aching dryness, his skin and lips perpetually cracked from lack of moisture.\n\nHis horse, Ripper, nickered restlessly at the stall door, eager to be set free. Fang nodded, swinging the creaky gate wide. Ripper exploded out into the wind, his mane and tail streaming behind him like banners.\n\nAs Fang watched Ripper gallop away, a dark shape appeared on the horizon. The horse's ears folded back in alarm. Fang's grip on the gate tightened.\n\n\"You ain't a bird, that's for sure,\" Fang muttered, eyes fixed on the shape as it drew closer.\n\nIt resolved into a great black stallion, its mane and tail as wild as Ripper's, though his eyes seemed tempered with a somber calm. Fang's skin prickled as the stallion approached him, not seeming to care for the turmoil around him.\n\n\"I'll be,\" Fang breathed, stunned. \"You're the stranger horse.\"\n\nThere was a silence, and then the stallion spoke in a voice that was almost too quiet to hear, though it boomed deep within Fang's chest.\n\n\"I've come for a favor,\" he said, his words as rough as the wind outside. \"You've got a waterhole near here, haven't you?\"\n\nFang nodded, his mouth dry at the very thought of water. \"You mean the old spring? That's the only water within miles.\"\n\nThe stallion nodded. \"I've been tracking. I need it, see. My people... we're in dire need of water. This drought has nearly killed us.\"\n\nA weight settled in Fang's chest. He knew what it was like, to feel the pain of a parched land and withered bones. He made a decision.\n\n\"Follow me,\" he said, turning into the storm.\n\nThe two of them splashed through standing water and muck, the wind driving the darkness in front of them. They were closer to the spring when a bolt of lightning split the sky, the sound striking Fang's eardrums like a heavy hand.\n\nRipper, who'd been running alongside Fang's horse, shied away, whinnying loudly. But when Fang glanced at the stranger's horse, he saw the animal stood calmly, eye fixed on the spring in front of them.\n\n\"Looks like I'm glad we got here before it poured,\" Fang said to the stallion.\n\nThe storm had not yet broken, the air thick and heavy as they finally reached the waterhole. It was a small oasis, where water bubbled out from a low-lying rock.\n\nThe stranger's horse began to drink, while Fang tied off his own mount. He dropped to his stomach, reaching into the water to splash his face and take a long, sweet drink. He rolled back onto his backside, staring up at the sky.\n\nRain poured down then, sheets of it that obscured the moon and drowned the sound of the wind. Fang lay there, listening as the waterhole overflowed, washing away the dryness from the earth.\n\nThe stranger's horse, who'd finished drinking, stood looking at him with eyes that seemed to hold a quiet gratitude. Fang reached up to touch the stallion's nose.\n\n\"We might be stuck in this mess for a while,\" he said, his voice almost lost to the rain. \"But I reckon you're welcome to stay till it passes.\"\n\nThe stallion nodded, then turned to nuzzle his mount, as if to check if the other horse was safe.\n\nFang watched for a moment, then swung up onto his horse's back and led them both back to the ranch. They rode side by side, the storm driving water into their faces, the sound of rushing water washing away the dust from their tired skin.\n\nThey made their way back into the storm's sheltering darkness, and the horses' steady breathing brought a small comfort, reminding Fang that even in the heart of the drought, there was still life.\n\nThe ranch's door swung shut behind them, keeping out the storm. And in the quiet heat that clung to the buildings like a warm mist, Fang slipped to the ground. Ripper looked over at him, tired and wet, and Fang reached to stroke the horse's neck.\n\nThe stranger's horse, the dark stallion, followed Fang's movement, nudging him gently with his head. Fang looked up, and their eyes met in a moment of shared understanding.\n\nThe rain outside pounded on the roof, drowning out the sudden pounding of Fang's heart. He knew what it was like, living on the range with nothing but dust and the ache of thirst. And he knew he'd do whatever it took to help this stranger and his people make it through the worst of the drought.\n\n\"You're welcome to stay,\" Fang said again, louder into the turmoil outside.\n\nThe darker stallion nodded once, and Fang watched as the rain closed in, surrounding them in its own secret world, full of quiet and gratitude.\n\nFang stood there a moment, feeling a tentative peace settle in the place where his anxiety once was. For the first time, he felt a chance to make things right on the range. And for the first time, Fang felt grateful to see someone else.\n\nIn this dry and stormy world of pain and dust, Fang was willing to do what it took to bring life back, for himself and everyone else on the range. If it meant a stranger like this black stallion coming from afar, Fang welcomed it with wide arms, open heart.\n\nJust like Ripper, who had run without hesitation into the heart of the darkness.\n\nJust like Fang, who saw for the first time a chance to hope, and to hold onto a glimmer beyond the clouds.  \n\nAs the storm showed no signs of abating, Fang led the way toward his quarters. He wanted to know more about the stallion, but as he shut the door behind him, he was met with only the silence of his own thoughts.\n\nHe smiled to himself, knowing he had no idea what the future held, or what his people would look like once they were free from this drought.\n\n\"I reckon that's okay,\" Fang said to the darkness around him. \"We can take our time figuring things out, as long as there's water to flow between us.\" \n\nHe walked toward his fireplace, rubbing his dry hands, as if feeling for a long time gone, forgotten but not entirely extinguished.\n\nFang went to sleep that night thinking the storm will teach us a lesson, or teach us how to survive with less and yet create new life when you least expect it. For on the very eve of desperation, amidst darkness, all he held onto – for the first time in months – was hope. \n\nFor Fang, something was beginning, some new journey.   In this dark range, that new path, however little was visible, somehow already made sense. He realized the range would survive – and perhaps even flourish – if Fang, his people and this stranger could stand the pain and keep going.\n\nA new beginning started with nothing, and only two men trying to survive it. Fang understood that even with all the suffering, only a single man's courage would bring light back to dry dusty land. For that tiny spark of hope, Fang took it as a gift. \n\nFor the first time, Fang opened himself up, heart and mind.  He asked for no reward, no recognition. Fang realized he was finally doing something other than fighting and trying to survive just to hang in there. He was doing something right. He stood for the stranger, the people he didn't even know.  He stood for the drought's parched victims. \n\nOne storm and a single rain storm made him know – and it would always remain – he had the capacity to do what no other man could - hope. Fang and the stranger held onto hope in a place that seemed to be slowly dying, a glimmer of something more.\n\nJust then, there was light – just a faint glimmer of one small light shining far in the distance. It flickered and seemed to grow into two lights, three lights, then a thousand. The drought was finally over. Fang, with his heart pounding at his ribs, smiled. He did not just smile with hope; no, it was for so much more. Fang had something bigger in his chest – thanksgiving. And that one flickering light had made his and his neighbor's darkness and his home transform into something he'd never even imagined.\n\nFor all men on the horizon, for all men behind the drought – it did finally pass. Fang realized his whole existence had changed. He was grateful for that flickering light, which was not a light at all but an act of one man giving thanks when all hope seemed lost. Fang found himself thanking his heart. For every man out there – it was Fang saying \"Thank you\" to his heart which never left. \n\nFor what came in the shape of two men's unbroken hope, finally ended two years of drought on the Texas plains. And it came just in time for two men - a long-lost soul and a stranger who walked out of the night, bringing the only things left in the universe to people left for dead - hope.\n\nTwo men came together and their hearts",
